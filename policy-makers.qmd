## Assess Innovation Systems

**Function 6, resources mobilisation:** 

- Are there sufficient financial resources for system development? 

- Do they correspond with the systemâ€™s needs? 

- What are they mainly used for (research/application/ pilot projects etc.)? 

- Is there sufficient risk capital? 

- Is there adequate public funding? 

- Can companies easily access the resources?

## reflection

What role do you (personally) have at Energymyndigheten? Was it different from your role in the game? How did you view the role that you usually have in the game?

What aspects of the game did you recognize from reality?
