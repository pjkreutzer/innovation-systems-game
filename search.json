A watch and a score board will make the game easier to facilitate.\n\nRole Cards\n Download docx file \nFor each role there is a role card. The government and industry should be given out only once. The other roles can be given out more often. I recommend to play with at least two university and two company researchers. When playing with only ten people, consider giving one citizen the NGO role as a bonus. When playing with 15 players, you may want to add at least one more innovator. The election after round 5 offers the players a chance to obtain a new role. If the government is replaced, the old government becomes a citizen, either trading with the citizen that has been elected as new government or taking the card of whoever replaces the other role. For example, if the industry player is elected as the new government, a citizen replaces them as industry (usually this can be quickly decided through volunteers or through another small election). You may also ask the group if they want to switch some roles voluntarily at this point, without it impacting game play.\n\n\nScore Board\n Download xlsx file \nTo help with keeping score, you can download an excel tool. By splitting the workbook view, you can show one sheet to the students which automatically updates when you insert the points of each round. Comments in the file will show you how it works.",

    "text": "Game Instructions and Player Rules\nThe game instructions can be found in the rules Section. While it is not important for students to have a clear understanding of all roles, as facilitator you should be aware of all role’s functions and special features.\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the game arises when students begin to interact with the rules themselves. The instructions do not cover all possible cases and eventualities.\nFor example, the instructions do not specify what else government can do. Usually students quickly think of certain new rules. They may wonder, for example, if government can pass a law which requires a certain number of environmental innovations to be played, such as one every round, or one for every two normal innovations etc.\nThe instructions also do not specify wether or not students can change seats (assuming you play sitting around a table). Or wether the industry roles can fire its researchers, or if they can quit etc.\nDepending on your specific teaching needs, this may even be an asset. However, you are of course free to adapt, add or change rules as you see fit. For example, if you are interested in teaching about the importance of clustering, maybe space out the researcher roles for the first five rounds and only allow them to move afterwards.\nWhile it makes sense to think about some possible extra rules, your students are likely going to surprise you with an idea for a new rule or option during the game anyways.\nOne of the more obvious loopholes that students will ask about is to consume something else than the specified 5, or 3 coins. While I was expecting the environmentally conscious roles to eventually stop consuming all together, I was very amused when an economy-minded citizen asked if they could consume more.\nUse your own judgement in these cases. Part of the fun is to create institutional innovation, such as new rules, but as facilitator make sure that a single change does not destroy the entire mechanism of the game. For example, consuming for 10 instead of 5 may still be a fun new player behavior and is likely to cancel out with other consuming less; consuming for 100 on the other hand may be too much.",

With some time to cover questions, and a brief repetition of the rules, you have about 50 minutes for the 10 rounds. This means that on average one round should take 5 minutes. As facilitator you should keep an eye on the overall time and try to develop a feeling for the flow of the game. The first rounds will take a bit longer for everyone to settle in. So will round 5 with the election. Use this to your advantage to add some mild stress in other rounds, so that the innovators cannot think too long about which cards to play.\nThe flow of the game is greatly helped if each group (citizens and funding bodies) sum up their points for you.",

The assigned reading here is chosen to highlight that innovation is a phenomenon happening embedded in a system. But other readings and points could perhaps also be made with the game. For example, if you are more interested in the geography of innovation, perhaps a paper about spillover effects together with new rules regarding the seating arrangements works better for you.\nHere are some questions that can be used directly after the game and in a follow up seminar, after students have read the assigned paper. It is of course also possible to require the reading before the game is played and have the discussions directly following the game.\nApart from the topical knowledge, these questions also focus on other sustainability competencies (Brundiers et al. 2021).\n\nPost Game Questions\n\nWhat happened?\nHow did you feel in your role?\nDo you feel you “won”?\nWhat moment was decisive for the game outcome?\nWhat were you thinking about the other players in the game?\nDid something that could have happened not happen (e.g., the government passing laws? Citizens stopping to consume at all?) Why or why not?\n\n\n\nQuestions on System Functions\n\nIf we think about to the iceberg heuristic (Figure 1), can we identify new or different ways in which functions were fulfilled?\nWhat knowledge was developed in the game? By whom and when?\nHow is knowledge diffused both in the game and in reality?\nWhat would have happened if one (or both) of the indicators were more delayed?\nWhat would have been needed to have a different game?\nHow aware were you of the game mechanisms during the game versus after?

One representing the economy and one the environment. The environmental indicator ranges from 0 - 10; from completely destroyed to a perfectly intact environment. At the beginning of the game its value is 10. The economy indicator starts at 100 and develops from there. Each round the environmental indicator decreases by 1% (rounded to the nearest integer) of the economy indicator. Since there is no free lunch, the environment degrades by 1 point even if the economy is less than 50 points.\nOver the course of the game, you will:\nThe game ends after ten rounds, if the environment is fully depleted, or if the economy is negative for two rounds.

Therefore the environmental indicator is decreased by 2 (1.5 rounded up to the nearest full number). Round 2 begins with the indicators at 150 and 8.\n\n\n\nfund innovation by deciding how many cards to draw from a deck;\ninnovate by playing matching cards;\nconsume as much as you want.\n\n\n\n1. Setting Innovation Goals\nAt the beginning of each round, the innovation goals are formulated. While the university researcher is free to set their goals, the company researchers have to follow the orders of the industry player.\n\nExample: Industry decides that they want a new economic innovation. If the innovators can, they must play a innovation for the economy in step 3.\n\nAt this step, the industry and the Government also decide how much they want to spend on innovation in this round. One card costs 5 points subtracted from the economic indicator.\n\nExample: The Government decides to spend 10 points. The university researcher gets to draw two cards. Industry decides to spend 20 points, it’s innovators are allowed to draw 4 cards.\n\n\n\n2. Innovators draw cards\nEach innovator draws cards according to their budget.\n\n\n3. Innovation\nWhen the innovators have collected a pair of cards of the same value, they can play them as an innovation. The innovation then adds to the scoreboards. For an economic innovation, twice the sum of the face values is added to the economic indicator (Aces count as 1, J,Q,K as ten). If an environmental innovation is played, only its sum is added, at the same time one point is added to the environmental indicator. If the innovators play four of a kind at the same time, the effects of the innovation are doubled.\n\nExample: The innovators play the pair 6 of hearts and 6 of diamonds as an economic process innovation. The economic indicator increases by 24 points. The innovators play 4 kings as a radical environmental innovation; 40 points are added to the economic indicator (4*10) and the environment improves by 2.\n\nIf no innovation can be played, the innovators keep the cards they drew in their hands.\n\n\n4. Consumption\nEach round the citizens decide if they want to consume a regular product or an environmental product, adding 5 or 3 points to the economy indicator, respectively. The citizens aim to maximize their consumption in accordance with their environmental preferences stated on their cards. They also have different preferences for the state of the economy.\n\n\n5. Evaluating the Outcomes\nThe effects of all decision during the round are added to the indicators.\n\n\n6. Discussion of Round and Negotiation of Next Round\nEach round ends with an open discussion of the events in the round. Were you satisfied? What should be done next round?",

Aim for your reflection to be around 750 words.\nSome questions to help your reflections are:\nIt is not important that you answer all of them, or any for that matter. They are meant as guidance rather than expectations. If you have another aspect that you would like to reflect upon, please do. The important part is that you present some thought about innovation systems literature and your personal experience in the first seminar.\nDuring the seminar you will first discuss your reflections in small groups of up to five people. Please make sure to read the reflections of others before hand. At the end we will discuss your reflections together.\nApart from the required reading you may find Wieczorek and Hekkert (2012) helpful for a deeper understanding of influencing innovation systems. While the entire book Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Meadows (2009) is a great read, for this reflection you may find chapter 4 Why Systems Surprise Us particularly useful.",

Are there tradeoffs between the functions of an innovation system and sustainability transitions?
