The general process of convergence was also accompanied by dramatic shifts in countries' productivity rankings. The paper extends the simple catch-up hypothesis to rationalize the fluctuating strength of the process and explores the connections between convergence itself and the relative success of early leaders and latecomers.},

Initiatives to date have developed biodiversity indicators for specific business contexts (e.g., spatial scales—from site, to product, to regional, or corporate scales); however, many are not widely translatable across different contexts making it challenging for businesses seeking indicators to manage their biodiversity performance. By synthesising the steps of common conservation and business decision-making systems, we propose a framework to support more comprehensive development of quantitative biodiversity indicators, for a range of business contexts. The framework integrates experience from existing tried-andtested conservation frameworks. We illustrate how our framework offers a pathway for businesses to assess their biodiversity performance and demonstrate responsible management by mitigating and reversing their biodiversity impacts and sustaining their dependencies, enabling them to demonstrate their contribution to emerging global biodiversity targets (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity post-2020 targets).},

Evolutionary, neo-Schumpeterian, and complex system dynamics approaches are conceptually attractive, and we examine their respective virtues and limitations. Both qualities are readily visible when one tries to connect systems-relevant research with practical policy-making in this field.},

We test the theory using panel data on patents by 8,562 automobile-sector firms in 41 countries, environmental willingness-topay, and competition. As predicted, exposure to prosocial attitudes fosters clean innovation, all the more so where competition is strong. Plausible increases in both together can spur it as much as a large fuel-price increase.},

Over 18 million tons of wood pellets were traded by EU member countries in 2018 of which a third were imported from the US. Concerns exist about negative impacts on US forests but systematic assessments are currently lacking. We assessed variability in fundamental attributes for timberland structure and carbon stocks within 123 procurement landscapes of wood pellet mills derived from over 38 thousand forest inventory plots in the eastern US from 2005 to 2017. We found more carbon stocks in live trees, but a fewer number of standing-dead trees, associated with the annual operation of large-scale wood pellet mills. In the US coastal southeast—where US pellet exports to the EU originate—there were fewer live and growing-stock trees and less carbon in soils with every year of milling operation than in the rest of the eastern US—which supplies the domestic market. Greater overlap of mills’ procurement areas exhibited discernible increments across selected carbon stocks. These trends likely reflect more intensive land management practices. Localized forest impacts associated with the wood pellet industry should continue to be monitored.},

  abstract = {Global wood consumption trends are reviewed in the context of framing a coherent forest policy in the era of climate change. Over the period 1980 to 2007, global wood consumption has been essentially stagnant, increasing by only 0.4\% per year. In contrast over the same period, global consumption of wood products increased steadily, paper by an average 3.2\% per annum and solid wood products (sawn timber and wood panels) by 0.8\% per annum. Wood saving explains these significantly different growth trajectories in unprocessed wood and processed wood products. Wood saving strategies include recycling paper (in particular), investing in higher yielding pulp technologies, substituting reconstituted wood panels for sawn timber and plywood and growing high pulp-yielding trees in a plantation regime. China's rapidly growing wood products industry has lifted wood saving to a new high. Consistent with the theory of induced innovation, China has so far avoided triggering a global wood shortage and associated wood price increases through a progression of strategies: successful pre-emptive price negotiations, increased use of recycled paper, adoption of high-yielding pulp technologies, substitution of reconstituted wood panels for sawn timber and tree planting substituting for natural forest supply. If China's current wood saving strategies were emulated worldwide, through increased use of recycled paper in particular, and to a lesser extent, substitution of reconstituted wood panels for sawn timber and plywood, the already low growth in global wood consumption would flatten further and perhaps start to decline. These economic realities in the wood products industry align positively with the interlinked imperatives of biodiversity conservation and carbon storage in natural forests, if wood-saving is converted to forest-saving.},

  abstract = {Historically, the growth of energy consumption has fuelled human development, but this approach is no longer socially and environmentally sustainable. Recent analyses suggest that some individual countries have responded to this issue successfully by decoupling Total Primary Energy Supply from human development increase. However, globalisation and international trade have allowed high-income countries to outsource industrial production to lower income countries, thereby increasingly relying on foreign energy use to satisfy their own consumption of goods and services. Accounting for the import of embodied energy in goods and services, this study proposes an alternative estimation of the Decoupling Index based on the Total Primary Energy Footprint rather than Total Primary Energy Supply. An analysis of 126 countries over the years 2000–2014 demonstrates that previous studies based on energy supply highly overestimated decoupling. Footprint-based results, on the other hand, show an overall decrease of the Decoupling Index for most countries (93 out of 126). There is a reduction of the number of both absolutely decoupled countries (from 40 to 27) and relatively decoupled countries (from 29 to 17), and an increase of coupled countries (from 55 to 80). Furthermore, the study shows that decoupling is not a phenomenon characterising only high-income countries due to improvements in energy efficiency, but is also occurring in countries with low Human Development Index and low energy consumption. Finally, six exemplary countries have been identified, which were able to maintain a continuous decoupling trend. From these exemplary countries, lessons have been identified in order to boost the necessary global decoupling of energy consumption and achieved welfare.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is often considered to be the major factor limiting tree growth in northern forest ecosystems. An increased N availability, however, increases the demand for other nutrients such as base cations and phosphorous (P) which in turn may change which nutrient is the limiting factor. If P or base cations become limiting, N will start to leach which means a risk of increased eutrophication of surface waters. As many studies focus on base cations, this study instead aims at estimating P budgets on a regional scale for different harvesting scenarios relevant for Swedish conditions. P budget calculations were carried out for 14,550 coniferous sites from the Swedish National Forest Inventory, as weathering+deposition-harvesting-leaching. Three scenarios with different harvest intensities were used: 1) no harvesting, 2) stem harvesting and 3) whole-tree harvesting. The input data were derived from measurements and model results. The P budget estimates indicate that harvesting, especially whole-tree harvesting, result in net losses of P in large parts of Sweden. The highest losses were found in southern Sweden due to high growth rate in this area. In the whole-tree harvesting scenario the losses exceeded 1 kg ha(-1)y(-1) on many sites. N budget calculations on the same sites indicate that N generally accumulates in the whole country and especially in the southern parts. Consequently, the N and P budget calculations indicate that the forests in southern Sweden are in a transition phase from N-to P-limitation to growth. This transition will proceed as long as the accumulation of N continues. These results are important in a sustainable forestry context, as a basis for assessing the risk of future N leaching, and in designing recommendations for abatement strategies of N deposition and for application of wood ash recycling and N fertilization.

In parts of Sweden, where the nitrogen deposition has been intermediate to high during recent decades, there are indications that the soils are close to nitrogen saturation. In this study, four different approaches were used to assess the risk of nitrogen leaching from forest soils in different parts of Sweden. Nitrate concentrations in soil water and C:N ratios in the humus layer where interpreted, together with model results from mass balance calculations and detailed dynamic modelling. All four approaches pointed at a risk of nitrogen leaching from forest soils in southern Sweden. However, there was a substantial variation on a local scale. Basing the assessment on four different approaches makes the assessment robust.},

  abstract = {The contribution of forest harvesting to base cation losses and soil acidification has increased in recent years in Sweden, as the demand for bioenergy has increased and the sulphur deposition has decreased. Thus, new policy tools are required to evaluate the progress of the recovery from acidification, and as a basis for forest management recommendations. In this study we introduce and test a concept, “Critical biomass harvesting”. The concept builds on the concept “Critical loads”, which has been used world-wide for several decades as a bridge between science and policies related to transboundary air pollution and acidification. The basis for the concept is an acidity mass balance, with sources and sinks of acidity. A critical limit defines the highest acceptable acidification status of the water leaving the root zone. Based on the critical limit, the highest allowed biomass harvesting can be calculated, keeping the other parameters constant. In this study the critical limit was set to ANC (Acid Neutralizing Capacity) = 0. Nitrogen was assumed to be affecting acidity only if it leaches from the root zone. The critical biomass harvesting was calculated for almost 12000 National Forest Inventory sites with spruce and pine forest, using the best available data on deposition, weathering and nitrogen leaching. The exceedance of critical biomass harvesting was calculated as the difference between the estimated harvest losses and the critical biomass harvesting. The results were presented as median values in merged catchments in a catchment database, with totally 2079 merged catchments in Sweden. According to the calculations, critical biomass harvesting was exceeded in the southern half of Sweden already at stem harvesting in spruce forests. Whole-tree harvesting expanded the exceedance area, and increased the exceedance levels in southern Sweden. The exceedance in pine forest was lower and affected smaller areas. It was concluded that the concept of critical biomass harvesting can be successfully applied on the same database that has been used for critical load calculations in Sweden, using basically the same approach as has been extensively applied, evaluated and discussed in a critical load context. The results from the calculations in Sweden indicate that whole-tree harvesting, without wood ash recycling, can be expected to further slow down recovery, especially in the most acidified parts of the country, in the southwest.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a combined theoretical and empirical assessment of energy democracy and degrowth in relation to the case study of a city's municipally-owned energy company in Sweden. Energy democracy is a fairly new concept and is a normative proposal that aims at articulating prospects for reduction of consumption, resource efficiency, use of renewable sources of energy and community empowerment. Though degrowth and energy democracy have similar goals and orientation, a combined analysis of both normative proposals remains underdeveloped. The focus on energy democracy serves us to articulate a deeper discussion on how technology, energy use and sustainability challenges interplay with definitions and meanings of degrowth vis-a -vis processes of capital accumulation. Empirically, we use the case of a municipality-based project of energy extraction and distribution in Sweden to discuss degrowth and energy democracy perspectives in this context. Theoretically, we develop insights from critical theories of technology. A main conclusion of the paper is that prospects for energy democracy and degrowth are limited in the energy project approached in the paper as it is based on the use of forest resources-a contested resource in the area - and also because this project assumes the development of economic processes oriented towards economic growth within the framework of capital accumulation.},

In contrast to that dominant approach, this paper outlines a variety of what the authors call ‘low-tech’ options e such as solar shower bags, washing lines, alternative heating and cooling methods, and cycling e and raises questions about the extent to which these types of ‘simple living’ practices could help increase household resilience in conditions of economic disruption, instability, or crisis. The analysis is framed by an ‘energy descent’ scenario, in which an individual, household or community either chooses a reduced-energy way of life, motivated by climate change mitigation, or has such a way of life imposed upon them due to declining fossil fuel availability or economic disruption. The authors see such a future as plausible e and in some contexts has already arrived or has always been the case e hence the relevance of this analysis, which has both quantitative and qualitative dimensions. Furthermore, while the focus herein is on low-tech living at the household level, it is argued that prefiguring a ‘simpler way’ to live has deeper significance too, in that it could help create the cultural conditions needed for a politics and macroeconomics of degrowth to emerge, which the authors maintain is a necessary part of any decarbonisation project. Challenges facing low-tech options are also acknowledged, including the everpresent risk of rebound effects and other indirect impacts.},

This last possible object of transition – society – is where values, models and goals come into conflict. This study examines this controversy through the lens of the ‘bioeconomics vs bioeconomy’ debate, in which proponents of bioeconomics have raised an arsenal of critiques against what they consider the simplistic promises of public and private promoters of the bioeconomy. We discuss these critiques, which are mainly macro in scale and/or narrative-centred, and argue for a complementary research effort that supports transition initiatives. This research could take place on three fronts: better understanding bioeconomic systems, evaluating bioeconomic transitions, and identifying how to implement these transitions.},

To capture the main elements of this paradigm shift, we introduce the concept of Sustainability-oriented Innovation Systems (SoIS). SoIS make particularly high demands on governance, because governments need to disrupt unsustainable technological pathways and encourage alternative technologies long before they reach the stage of commercial viability. This implies picking winners in situations of technological uncertainty and highly disparate stakeholder preferences. SoIS also build on new types of policies that help to internalise environmental costs. The policy-driven nature of technological development may possibly result in a wide divergence of national technological trajectories.},

Similar to other studies, harvesting phases that contributed the most were logging, loading and transport. Concerning LCA stages, forest equipment operation generated the highest CO2e level across the three harvesting systems where fuel consumption was the activity that contributed with 76\% of CO2e for the mechanized system, and 50\% in the case of the tower logging and semi-mechanized systems. The mechanized system had the highest fuel use efficiency and the lowest CO2e emissions.},

The compilation of chapters shows the diversity and variation of development pathways that entail valuable lessons and implications for how to approach this difficult question. It shows the importance of acknowledging that the process of development is dynamic and that the possibilities for catch-up are situation dependent. At the same time it makes clear that without structural change, in particular the agricultural transformation, sustained catching up is unlikely to happen. Instead of clinging on to universal templates, the analysis of current growth processes in the developing world will be enriched by paying closer attention to the multifaceted nature of both economic backwardness and successful pathways to escape it. The chapters of this volume, situated in the borderland of Economic History and Development Economics, are pertinent examples of how the research agenda about long-term development and catching up can be informed.},

  abstract = {Promoting global energy transitions while stimulating domestic industrialization requires national policymaking that shapes technological innovation towards specific outcomes. Although this is inherently difficult, historical case studies may bring a better understanding of innovation dynamics and thereby guide the design of future policy interventions. The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze the emergence of Swedish photovoltaics technology from a policy perspective. Our main aim is to provide a retrospective account of historical developments, but we also derive more general insights about technological innovation and related policy challenges. The paper departs from an adapted analytical framework based on the technological innovation systems approach. Our review identifies four decades of Swedish research that has largely failed to drive domestic commercialization, the rise and fall of an industry that mainly served international markets, and a rapidly growing domestic market based on imported products. This situation is the result of mismatches and fragmentation among key innovation processes, which have not been addressed by strategic policy interventions. We suggest that policymakers should promote a full range of innovation processes and consider making innovation support subject to a payback mechanism that delivers a return on public investments even if industries and markets emerge abroad. Our study also demonstrates how the technological innovation systems approach can be extended to include the function commercialization and emphasizes the importance of paying attention to the directionality of technological innovation processes.},

Here, we use purposefully collected data from 87 sites to model how agricultural habitats, including semi-natural pastures, sown temporary grassland (leys), cereal crops, and forest habitats comprising both mature production forests and clear-cuts, contribute to landscape-scale diversity of plants, bumblebees and butterflies in boreonemoral Sweden. At the local scale, species richness was highest in semi-natural pastures, intermediate in cereal crops and leys and lowest in forest. In clear-cuts, species richness was similarly high to that in semi-natural pastures. Countryside species-area models show that at a landscape scale, the high local richness in clear-cuts was more than offset by the low species richness encountered in forest. At landscape scale, semi-natural pastures, and in the case of plants also cereal crops, were major contributors of unique species. Leys and semi-natural pastures were both important contributors to bumblebee diversity. The effect of the surrounding landscape composition on local diversity was weak, suggesting that area-based approximations of landscape-scale species richness were reasonable. We conclude that clear-cuts constitute habitats for open-land species but cannot maintain landscape-scale diversity in the face of agricultural abandonment when open land is replaced by even-aged production forests. Maintaining farmland, in particular semi-natural pastures but also cereals and leys, is therefore critical to maintaining the landscape-scale species richness of plants and insects in forestry-dominated areas.},

  abstract = {Social norms have been investigated across many disciplines for many years, but until recently, studies mainly provided indirect, implicit and correlational support for the role of social norms in driving behaviour. To understand how social norms, and in particular social norm change, can generate a large-scale behavioural change to deal with some of the most pressing challenges of our current societies, such as climate change and vaccine hesitancy, we discuss and review several recent advances in social norm research that enable a more precise underpinning of the role of social norms: how to identify their existence, how to establish their causal effect on behaviour and when norm change may pass tipping points. We advocate future research on social norms to study norm change through a mechanism-based approach that integrates experimental and computational methods in theory-driven, empirically calibrated agent-based models. As such, social norm research may move beyond unequivocal praising of social norms as the missing link between self-interested behaviour and observed cooperation or as the explanation for (the lack of) social tipping. It provides the toolkit to understand explicitly where, when and how social norms can be a solution to solve large-scale problems, but also to recognize their limits.

  abstract = {The boreal forest is in transition. Large areas in remote regions are still in a pristine state, but extensive exploitation or intensive management for wood production dominates in Russia, Canada and the Nordic countries. The broadened view that forests are sources of other products than wood as well as of biodiversity is gradually becoming internationally accepted. To sustain the boreal forest for the future it must be realised that the forest has to be sustained as a system rather than as a number of utilities that can be considered separately. In northern Europe the situation is particularly striking with a strong contrast between the adjacent boreal forests in Scotland, Sweden and Finland on the one hand, and the north-west of Russia on the other. The two regions differ by history, type of land use and economic system but they are basically biologically similar. Combining sustainable wood production and maintenance of biodiversity and other values means setting limits to the intensity and extent of forest management. If the impact has been large, it is also necessary to build more natural features into managed systems. Developing a sustained boreal forest system by management of forests and forests reserves can be more efficient if research, education and management are well integrated. Scientists, teachers and managers must meet frequently and interact. In this way the time-lag between the advent of new knowledge and its implementation in the field can be reduced. We argue that co-operation among contrasting regions like the east and the west provides a unique opportunity for such integration, We review the problems and requirements in the west and the east, respectively, by contrasting Scotland, Sweden and the Komi Republic in Russia. The experiences are different and therefore complementary to each other. This assures long-term benefits of joint action.},

Given the diversity of biophysical conditions, economic histories and governance systems on the European continent, regionally and temporally adapted and adaptive solutions are needed for both social and ecological systems. To illustrate this, we apply (1) a biographic forest and woodland history approach to central Sweden's Bergslagen region, where boreal sustained yield forestry was widely applied first and (2) a comparative case study approach using five European landscapes that represent different forest history phases in Scotland, Germany, Ukraine and Russia. Additionally, we illustrate the need to learn from reference landscapes for natural forest and cultural woodland systems such as in economically remote regions in Romania, Russia and on the Iberian Peninsula. We conclude that there is great opportunity for innovative knowledge production about both governance and management for different SFM dimensions based on comparisons among concrete landscapes. In addition, there is a need to develop local place-based social learning processes that are characterized by a focus on a geographical area, commitment to SFM policy visions and collaborative approaches to development that include both ecological and social systems.},

Second, we compared the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification standards' ecological indicators from 1998 and 2010 in Sweden to the normative model using a Specific, Measurable, Accurate, Realistic, and Timebound (SMART) indicator approach. Indicator variables and targets for riparian and aquatic ecosystems were clearly under-represented compared to terrestrial ones. FSC's ecological indicators expanded over time from composition and structure towards function, and from finer to coarser spatial scales. However, SMART indicators were few. Moreover, they poorly reflected quantitative evidence-based knowledge, a consequence of the fact that forest certification mirrors the outcome of a complex social negotiation process.},

We compared growth rates of young Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies H. Karst.) at 58 degrees, 60 degrees, 62 degrees, 64 degrees N in both countries. Stands on rich, mesic and poor sites were sampled using the intercept method as an indicator of the actual tree growth rate. Young Scots pine growth did not differ between NW Russia and Sweden, and should thus, if managed in the same way, have the same rate of wood production. However, for Norway spruce growth rates were 20 per cent lower in Russia than in Sweden. This was linked to few young spruce trees growing without removing competing deciduous trees in Russia. All Swedish stands had been pre-commercial cleaned, but this treatment had only been applied to 5 per cent of the Russian stands. We discuss that intensification towards sustainable forest management requires knowledge not only about forest ecology, but also a toolbox for governance, planning and management. This requires learning about societal development trajectories linked to ownership, governance and tenure systems as well as forest landscape history.},

  abstract = {Implementing sustainable forest management (SFM) policy on the ground is not straightforward, and depends on the social-ecological context. To meet the need for place-based stakeholder collaboration towards regionally adapted knowledge production and learning in support of SFM an integrated landscape approach can assist. Hosting most of the circumboreal forest Russia is a key global player. To transition boreal forestry in the Russian Federation from wood mining towards SFM after the collapse of USSR several initiatives were initiated. Our aim is to review the outcomes and consequences of the initiatives employing the international Model Forest concepts' six principles in Russia. To identify candidates for the study we identified 12 local initiatives using this term, all in Russia's boreal forest biome. However, while seven demonstration forests focused on improving wood production practices, five were long-term stakeholder-driven development processes aimed at SFM, and were approved members of the International Model Forest Network. The five latter were selected for a detailed study to understand their temporal dynamic in the circumboreal Model Forest context, and the extent to which they complied with the six principles of the Model Forest concept as an example of a landscape approach. The sources, amounts and durations of these initiatives' funding affected both outcomes and consequences on the ground. All five had developed a partnership that formally shared a commitment to SFM. However, not all areas were large enough to represent all dimensions of SFM. Not all Model Forests developed a representative, participative, transparent, and accountable governance structure, which affected the programs of their activities. Finally, knowledge-sharing, capacity-building and networking at multiple levels was variable. In spite of Russia hosting most of the circumboreal forest the Model Forest concept was not sustained in Russia due to ending of foreign project funding, to limited continuity of committed local capacity, and poor support from national-level decision makers. The exception is the Komi Model Forest's transition to a successful consulting company focusing on SFM. To develop regionally adapted approaches to implement SFM policy we stress the importance of sharing experiences from Model Forests as well as other landscape approach concepts among countries and regions with different landscape histories and governance arrangements. To enhance this, we propose a general analytic framework for learning through evaluation about place-based long-term initiatives that integrate evidence-based knowledge about states and trends of sustainability and cross-sector multi-level governance.},

Using the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi target \#11 with its quantitative and qualitative criteria as a normative model, we aim at supporting landscape planning through a pioneering assessment of the extent to which existing amounts and spatial distributions of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) meet these criteria. Highly forested and committed to both intensive wood production and evidence-based conservation targets of 17–20\% protected areas, Sweden was chosen as a case study. Specifically, we estimated the amount, regional representation, and functional connectivity of HCVF patches using virtual bird species, validated the results using field surveys of focal bird species, and assessed conservation target fulfilment. Finally, we linked these results to the regional distribution of forest land ownership categories, and stress that these provide different opportunities for landscape planning. Even if 31\% of forest land in Sweden is officially protected, voluntarily set-aside, or not used for wood production now and in the future, we show that applying the representation and connectivity criteria of Aichi target \#11 reduces this figure to an effective GI of 12\%. When disaggregating the five ecoregions the effective GI was 54\% for the sub-alpine forest ecoregion, which hosts EU’s last intact forest landscapes, but only 3–8\% in the other four ecoregions where wood production is predominant. This results in an increasing need for forest habitat and landscape restoration from north to south. The large regional variation in the opportunity for landscape planning stresses the need for a portfolio of different approaches. We stress the need to secure funding mechanisms for compensating land owners’ investments in GI, and to adapt both the approaches and spatial extents of landscape planning units to land ownership structure.},

In sustainability transitions research a broad conception of path dependence prevails, which covers a variety of historical barriers to transformation. We advocate for a more narrow conception of path dependence that focuses on the underlying self-reinforcing mechanisms. We introduce theoretical work from organisation studies into transition research to conceptualise path dependence at the level of socio-technical systems and organisations, and furthermore elaborate on the phenomenon of path break-out. Based on a literature review of European electricity transitions, we analyse how self-reinforcing mechanisms are weakening leading to path break-out. We identify two modes of path break-out. First, path dissolution is a result of exogenous shocks and unintentional weakening of self-reinforcing mechanisms. Second, path breaking is a result of an intentional attempt to change the exiting patterns, which weakens the self-reinforcing mechanisms.},

Awareness has existed for several years in Sweden that cooperation at the landscape level is essential for protecting areas of high environmental value. This awareness has come to expression in several projects and initiatives. One of these projects is the Östra Vätterbranterna Partnership, a successful example of the new orientation toward environmental management as formulated in the government bill Sustainable protection of nature areas: new working methods with a focus on collaboration and increased dialog by involving more actors and utilizing a greater combination of steering instruments. This development resonates with the growing trend toward deregulation and less state intervention in environmental management, implying a stronger emphasis on new governance structures and market-driven processes. This paper examines the preconditions for a development toward governance-oriented forms of steering in the area of environmental policy and law, with specific emphasis on the protection of forestry areas with high environmental value. Paralleling this development, the transformation of environmental public administration is analyzed, using a model representing three different perspectives on administration's role, values and meaning, showing state action's progressive transition from “rowing” to “steering” to “serving” and facilitating.},

  abstract = {Economic crises cause companies to reduce their investment, including investment in innovation where returns are uncertain and long-term. This has been confirmed by the 2008 financial crisis, which has substantially reduced the willingness of firms to invest in innovation. However, the reduction in investment has not been uniform across companies and a few even increased their innovation expenditures. Through the analysis of a fresh European Survey, this paper compares drivers of innovation investment before, during and following on from the crisis, applying the Schumpeterian hypotheses of creative destruction and technological accumulation. Before the crisis, incumbent enterprises are more likely to expand their innovation investment, while after the crisis a few, small enterprises and new entrants are ready to “swim against the stream” by expanding their innovative related expenditures.},

The definition was derived from a review of the systems thinking literature combined with the application of systems thinking to itself. Many different definitions of systems thinking can be found throughout the systems community, but key components of a singular definition can be distilled from the literature. This researcher considered these components both individually and holistically, then proposed a new definition of systems thinking that integrates these components as a system. The definition was tested for fidelity against a System Test and against three widely accepted system archetypes. Systems thinking is widely believed to be critical in handling the complexity facing the world in the coming decades; however, it still resides in the educational margins. In order for this important skill to receive mainstream educational attention, a complete definition is required. Such a definition has not yet been established. This research is an attempt to rectify this deficiency by providing such a definition.},

  abstract = {International policies have set sustainable development goals that put emphasis on bioeconomy strategies based on renewable resources. The forestry sector, by providing bio-based products, is expected to take part in this bioeconomy with, among other things, the reduction of society's dependence on fossil fuels. Nevertheless, in Europe, the forestry sector is facing an increase in the number of small private forest ownerships, called non-industrial private forests (NIPF), where wood mobilization is difficult due to both ownership fragmentation and the lack of interest of non-industrial forest owners in existing forest-wood chains. Although many policy instruments have been put in place to address this situation, the problem persists for two main reasons. First, a lack of use of policy instruments by forest owners and second, a lack of collaboration between stakeholders. To provide solutions, we propose a methodology to design territorial projects with non-industrial forest owners in the framework of a Living Lab innovation process. This paper presents both the general method developed and analyzed through open and user-centered innovation concepts and its practical implementation in the Vosges department in France. Our results show how the Living Lab approach can improve the acceptance, adoption and use of policy instruments by NIPF owners and how it promotes multi-stakeholder collaborations to design and deploy innovative solutions. The main interest of our study is to provide a methodology to pilot a forestry Living Lab for policy makers and practitioners, based on rigorous concepts of innovation management. Finally, future developments and limitations of our study are discussed in a global research perspective.},

Using a sample with 9172 firms from the Spanish Innovation Survey Panel, we study the impact of eco-innovation drivers for energy and environmental efficiency objectives. This research utilizes a combination of two methods: Ordinal Logit Regression Models and Artificial Neural Networks. The results allow us to compare the impact of each variable. From a methodological point of view, this approach allows overcoming the difficulties of performing a regression analysis, mainly due to the low levels of explained variance and the problem of comparing the regression coefficients obtained. From the Artificial Neural Networks analysis, it is observed that the factor that most affects the eco-innovation is the previous experiences in eco-innovation, compared to variables such as external financing or innovation capabilities, which have a very small impact. These results may have important repercussions from the point of view of developing environmental incentive policies.},

  abstract = {Conventional, neoclassical economics assumes perfectly rational agents (firms, consumers, investors) who face well-defined problems and arrive at optimal behaviour consistent with — in equilibrium with — the overall outcome caused by this behaviour. This rational, equilibrium system produces an elegant economics, but is restrictive and often unrealistic. Complexity economics relaxes these assumptions. It assumes that agents differ, that they have imperfect information about other agents and must, therefore, try to make sense of the situation they face. Agents explore, react and constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. The resulting outcome may not be in equilibrium and may display patterns and emergent phenomena not visible to equilibrium analysis. The economy becomes something not given and existing but constantly forming from a developing set of actions, strategies and beliefs — something not mechanistic, static, timeless and perfect but organic, always creating itself, alive and full of messy vitality.},

  abstract = {Countries are responding to unsustainable resource extraction, rising emissions, and increasing waste streams by implementing national bioeconomy strategies. Assuming that the purpose of a bioeconomy is to replace fossil use by biogenic resource use, we estimate biomass and fossil raw material consumption (RMC) by applying multiregional input–output methodology for middle and high income countries. Next, we use a panel fixed effects model to explain RMC with economically active population, urban population, GDP, land cover, and fossil/biomass domestic material consumption. With this model, we project RMC under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios up to 2050. The projections show an increase in per capita biomass RMC between 2010 and 2050, accompanied by—in many cases pronounced—per capita growth of fossil RMC across most of the countries and scenarios. We conclude that, if GDP continues to drive fossil RMC at its current magnitude, upcoming conditions are likely to counteract a potential bioeconomic transition and increase, instead of decrease, fossil RMC. Thus, increasing biomass use will not necessarily lead to reduced fossil resource consumption. When considering the relative scarcity of biomass, land and water, more focus needs to be placed on the relevance of technological bio-based innovations in the reconfiguration of RMC drivers.},

  abstract = {A large academic consensus exists on the idea that successful innovative processes are geographically bounded within regions. Nevertheless, the ability of regions to capture and re-use external knowledge is also regarded as a fundamental element to sustain and refine the local profile of specialisation and competitiveness. The present article combines these views to investigate the sources of the regional innovation process, by analysing data on Italian regions over the period 2007–2012. We define global networks based on all the local firms identifiable as global ultimate owners and their foreign subsidiaries. Our main results suggest that both the internal specialisation and the regional external linkages can generate indigenous innovation, but the role of the networks varies substantially according to its density, its degree of complementarity with the specialisation profile, its geographical spread and the specific location of the foreign subsidiaries. Our results, then, support a view of the regional innovation as an interactive process whereby valuable knowledge resources are not only generated within the reach of the local economy, but they are also integrated with external inputs. This contrasts with recent anti-globalisation views according to which the increase in the foreign operations of national companies impoverishes the local economy.},

Having major implications for the abilities of actors to pursue their interests in practical forest management, the methodologies of biodiversity mapping have been highly controversial and contested. We identify two different forest ontologies, or realities, that were enacted by the two main competing methodologies for such mapping. The methodologies, SiS and EiF, were supported by what we term the environmental and the forestry segments, respectively. Whereas a mapping approach associated with the environmental segment enacted a varied and complex forest ontology, a mapping approach related to the forestry segment enacted a comprehensible and more standardized forest ontology. In analyzing the two ontologies, we explore the links between the configuration of the mapping methodologies and 1) the forest realities they enact, 2) the scientific ideals they advocate, and 3) the relationship between mapping and management decisions. In particular, we argue that the ontologies have different political implications, generally favoring the actors that support them. On a more general level, we show that ontological politics is performed in the enactment of different ontologies related to different political segments, associated with different sectors.},

First, it discusses the field of transition studies, which deals with processes of structural change in societal systems on the basis of certain presumptions about power relations, but still lacks an explicit conceptualization of power. Then the article discusses some prevailing points of contestation in debates on power. It is argued that for the context of transition studies, it is necessary to develop an interdisciplinary framework in which power is explicitly conceptualized in relation to change. Subsequently, such a framework is presented, with reference to existing literature on power. Starting with a philosophical and operational definition of power, a typology is developed of the different ways in which power can be exercised, explicitly including innovative power and transformative power. Finally, the presented power framework is applied to transition studies, redefining pivotal transition concepts in terms of power and formulating hypotheses on the role of power in transitions. By doing so, the article not only offers an interdisciplinary framework to study power in the context of transition studies, but also contributes to power debates more generally by including innovation and transformation as acts of power, and thereby proposes a re-conceptualization of the relation between power and structural change.},

By contrast, Swedish natural forests and preindustrial cultural woodlands were ecologically and culturally diverse, with a substantial proportion having a continuous tree cover as a response to natural disturbance dynamics and preindustrial agricultural land management. If forest management systems do not mimic this diversity of disturbance regimes sufficiently well, the scope of sustainable forest management to include biodiversity and sociocultural values will not be met. This study estimated the past and present amount of one cultural and two natural disturbance regimes known to deliver continuous tree cover in two study areas located around two important biophysical and sociocultural transition zones in northern and southern Sweden, respectively. Several approaches were used to estimate the amount of remaining continuous tree cover forests. The results indicate that 9-10\% of the study areas is made up by site types that historically would have held a large proportion of continuous tree cover forests. Estimates for productive site types show that only 1-2\% of these sites remain in southern Sweden and 10-20\% in northern Sweden. The data indicate that present management in both study areas is similar. Thus, these differences between the regions will disappear in a few decades. To achieve the aim of Swedish forest and environmental policies there is a clear need to develop and use alternative forest management methods on appropriate sites.},

To satisfy the intentions of contemporary forest and land use policies, uneven-aged forest management systems as a complement are currently debated. We interviewed local forestry stakeholders in the Swedish boreal forest region's north and south about their views on and attitudes towards different forest management systems' contribution to SFM. Most stakeholders were generally negative to the use of uneven-aged system for sustained yield wood production but saw advantages for ecological and socio-cultural dimensions of SFM. To encourage the use of even-aged cohort and uneven-aged systems to satisfy all dimensions of SFM, there is a need for improved communication, education and public awareness. This could ultimately lead to a more constructive and less heated debate. In addition, there is a need of more empirically based knowledge about uneven-aged and cohort forest management systems' pros and cons when it comes to satisfying economical, ecological and socio-cultural objectives.},

  abstract = {Humans have unlimited wants. This foundational economic principle and widely accepted assumption about human nature poses considerable challenges to addressing sustainability because pursuing wealth and economic growth to meet unlimited wants increases resource use and pollution. Here we show evidence that this principle is not universal, and actually applies only to a minority of people. Across 42 community samples (N\,=\,7,860) from 33 countries spanning 6 continents, we examined how much money people wanted in their absolutely ideal life. In 86\% of countries the majority of people thought they would achieve their absolutely ideal lives with US\$10 million or less, and in some countries as little as US\$1 million or less. However, a substantial minority (8–39\% across countries) wanted as much money as they could obtain, indicating unlimited wants. Limited and unlimited wealth ideals were not related to country differences in economic development, but those with unlimited wants tended to be younger, city-dwelling people who valued power, success and independence, and lived in countries with a greater collective focus and acceptance of power differences. The results suggest that transformative approaches relying on limiting wealth and growth to achieve sustainability may be more consistent with human ideals and aspirations than commonly believed.},

  abstract = {Agricultural landscapes have changed fast in Europe, which has led to steep declines in farmland biodiversity. While this has differentially impacted “farmland species”, some of these seem to be able to use alternative man-made open habitats in forests, such as forest clear-cuts and powerline rights-of-way. We investigated the use of clear-cuts by two historically declining farmland birds, the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), to determine both local and landscape habitat characteristics of clear-cuts used for breeding. Among 101 clear-cuts visited in Scania, southern Sweden, 27\% were occupied by Yellowhammers and 12\% by Red-backed Shrikes. Yellowhammer occurrence in clear-cuts was positively related to local spruce cover (the planted tree species). There was also an interaction between clear-cut size and the proportion of farmland in the landscape, such that the positive effect of the proportion of farmland nearby was stronger for larger clear-cuts. Red-backed Shrike occurrence was positively related to clear-cut size and the local presence of piles of forest residues (tops and branches). The relation between occurrence and the proportion of clear-cuts in the landscape was positive for small clear-cuts and negative for larger ones. Yellowhammers and Red-backed shrikes are affected by both the local habitat structure in the clearcut and on the composition of the surrounding landscape, most likely because they use the clear-cut for nesting and the surroundings as complementary feeding habitat. To what extent clear-cuts as complementary breeding habitat to farmland may contribute to the conservation of Yellowhammers and Red-backed shrikes, as well as other farmland birds, is a promising path for future investigations.},

  abstract = {Between 1820 and 1990, the share of world income going to today's wealthy nations soared from twenty percent to almost seventy. Since then, that share has plummeted to where it was in 1900. As Richard Baldwin explains, this reversal of fortune reflects a new age of globalization that is drastically different from the old. In the 1800s, globalization leaped forward when steam power and international peace lowered the costs of moving goods across borders. This triggered a self-fueling cycle of industrial agglomeration and growth that propelled today's rich nations to dominance. That was the Great Divergence. The new globalization is driven by information technology, which has radically reduced the cost of moving ideas across borders. This has made it practical for multinational firms to move labor-intensive work to developing nations. But to keep the whole manufacturing process in sync, the firms also shipped their marketing, managerial, and technical know-how abroad along with the offshored jobs. The new possibility of combining high tech with low wages propelled the rapid industrialization of a handful of developing nations, the simultaneous deindustrialization of developed nations, and a commodity super-cycle that is only now petering out. The result is today's Great Convergence. Because globalization is now driven by fast-paced technological change and the fragmentation of production, its impact is more sudden, more selective, more unpredictable, and more uncontrollable. As The Great Convergence shows, the new globalization presents rich and developing nations alike with unprecedented policy challenges in their efforts to maintain reliable growth and social cohesion.--},

The underlying idea is that growth, development, technological change, income inequality, spatial disparities, and resilience are the visible outcomes of hidden systemic interactions. The study of economic complexity seeks to understand the structure of these interactions and how they shape various socioeconomic processes. This emerging field relies heavily on big data and machine learning techniques. This brief introduction to economic complexity has three aims. The first is to summarize key theoretical foundations and principles of economic complexity. The second is to briefly review the tools and metrics developed in the economic complexity literature that exploit information encoded in the structure of the economy to find new empirical patterns. The final aim is to highlight the insights from economic complexity to improve prediction and political decision-making. Institutions including the World Bank, the European Commission, the World Economic Forum, the OECD, and a range of national and regional organizations have begun to embrace the principles of economic complexity and its analytical framework. We discuss policy implications of this field, in particular the usefulness of building recommendation systems for major public investment decisions in a complex world.},

First, we look at whether inventive activities in climate-friendly domains depend on patenting in related technological domains that are not green. Based on patent data filed over the 1978–2014 period, we estimate a spatial autoregressive model using co-occurrence matrices to capture technological interdependencies. Our first finding highlights that the development of green technologies strongly relies on advances in other green and in particular non-green technological domains, whose relevance for the green economy is usually neglected. Building on this insight, we detect the non-green complementary technologies that co-occur with green ones and assess whether environmental policies affect this particular instantiation of technologies at the country level. The results of the instrumental variable approach confirm that while environmental policies spur green patenting, they do not displace the development of the non-green technological pillars upon which green inventions develop.},

Here we develop a self-consistent theory of dynamical perturbations in complex systems, allowing us to systematically separate the contribution of the network topology and dynamics. The formalism covers a broad range of steady-state dynamical processes and offers testable predictions regarding the system’s response to perturbations and the development of correlations. It predicts several distinct universality classes whose characteristics can be derived directly from the continuum equation governing the system’s dynamics and which are validated on several canonical network-based dynamical systems, from biochemical dynamics to epidemic spreading. Finally, we collect experimental data pertaining to social and biological systems, demonstrating that we can accurately uncover their universality class even in the absence of an appropriate continuum theory that governs the system’s dynamics.},

  abstract = {The bioeconomy has been portrayed as a transformational change to replace fossil-based fuels and other goods such as plastics. It is to substitute those goods while promoting zero-waste circular economies, creating jobs, and valorizing biodiversity – an agenda that meets conservation, climate and socioeconomic goals. Yet, where and from whom such bioresources are to come are questions that often receive insufficient scrutiny. Starting from an understanding that equity and sustainability essentially depend on how and on whose terms bio-based pro­ duction takes place, this article explores the social dimensions of bioeconomy promotion through a “just tran­ sition” lens. Using the experiences of Brazil, India and Indonesia as case studies, it examines their dominant biobased production systems in terms of distributional, procedural, retributive, and restorative justice. The analysis shows that, while such a bio-based transition has been a boon for agribusiness, the bioeconomy has so far helped promote broadly unjust production systems – where benefits and burdens are unevenly distributed, procedural governance over landscapes and resource use tends to be exclusionary, and there is little accountability or redress for past and present damages inflicted upon traditional communities and local populations. This pattern highly contrasts with the bioeconomy’s lip service to socioeconomic betterment and rural livelihood support. Instead, this examination shows bio-based sectors are expanding on many injustices while creating new ones. The conclusion is that, alongside fossil fuel substitution, a just bioeconomy transition also requires sustainable farming and land use – as two transitions in one. Therefore, asking where bio-based goods are produced, how, and by whom is essential.},

  abstract = {R\&D subsidies are often considered the main policy tool to stimulate the competitiveness and the innovativeness of firms. This is especially true for innovations designed to produce greener products or cleaner and more energy efficient technologies. However, a consistent literature has now shown that, even when a clean or a cost-reducing technology is ready available in the market, its spreading within (intra) or across (inter) households or firms takes several years and in some cases decades. Therefore, it is not only important to generate innovations (via investments in R\&D) but it is also important that such innovations are adopted and used by firms. This paper briefly illustrates the main theoretical approaches to the analysis of the factors leading to inter-firm diffusion and emphasise the existing gap led by the paucity of literature on intra-firm diffusion. A final section briefly discusses some methodological issues surrounding the diffusion of consumer (non-durable) technologies within and across households and how ad hoc models can be used to test the validity of environmental policies.},

  abstract = {The complexity of many biological, social and technological systems stems from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades, a variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks whose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, from human communications to chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions can often occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be described simply in terms of dyads. Until recently little attention has been devoted to the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems into account can enhance our modeling capacities and help us understand and predict their dynamical behavior. Here we present a complete overview of the emerging field of networks beyond pairwise interactions. We discuss how to represent higher-order interactions and introduce the different frameworks used to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize the structure of these systems and the models proposed to generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing bipartite graphs, hypergraphs and simplicial complexes. We introduce the rapidly growing research on higher-order dynamical systems and dynamical topology, discussing the relations between higher-order interactions and collective behavior. We focus in particular on new emergent phenomena characterizing dynamical processes, such as diffusion, synchronization, spreading, social dynamics and games, when extended beyond pairwise interactions. We conclude with a summary of empirical applications, and an outlook on current modeling and conceptual frontiers.},

To fill this gap, we assess perceptions of female leaders on the state of gender diversity in the Nordic forest industry, on the future of the forest sector in the bioeconomy, and on the potential contribution the Nordic forest industry can make to empower women, as promoted by the UN Sustainable Development Goals. An elite interviewing strategy was used to engage female leaders working at the top management level of seven Finnish and Swedish forest companies. According to our results, adapting to “being one of the boys” appears to persist as a norm for female leaders in this masculine industry field. Participants believed that their influence on the industry’s sustainability agenda comes from being in a senior management position, and is not a gender-related aspect. We conclude that the ability of the Nordic forest industry to adapt to strategic renewal into the bioeconomy will require a more diverse company culture, which is not solely gender-based and is fostered at all organizational levels.},

As is known from previous work on social networks trust-building is a key driver for collaboration, as actors tend to form collaborations with previous partners or indirectly connected partners, creating clustered networks.},

We integrate insights from network regulation and transition studies to propose a framework for understanding such challenges. With this framework we assess recent regulatory innovations in Norway. The paper shows how the regulatory toolbox can be amended to tackle innovation and transition. The Norwegian case shows that the regulator has taken up the energy transition challenges. It also shows the difficulties of making these new instruments effective, including the tension between a regulatory cost efficiency focus on the one hand, and transformative change on the other.},

  abstract = {Planetary boundaries (PBs) and global catastrophic risk (GCR) have emerged in recent years as important paradigms for understanding and addressing global threats to humanity and the environment. This article compares the PBs and GCR paradigms and integrates them into a unified PBs-GCR conceptual framework, which we call Boundary Risk for Humanity and Nature (BRIHN). PBs emphasizes global environmental threats, whereas GCR emphasizes threats to human civilization. Both paradigms rate their global threats as top priorities for humanity but lack precision on key aspects of the impacts of the threats. Our integrated BRIHN framework combines elements from both paradigms' treatments of uncertainty and impacts. The BRIHN framework offers PBs a means of handling human impacts and offers GCR a theoretically precise definition of global catastrophe. The BRIHN framework also offers a concise stage for telling a stylized version of the story of humanity and nature co-evolving from the distant past to the present to multiple possible futures. The BRIHN framework is illustrated using the case of disruptions to the global phosphorus biogeochemical cycle.},

As it encompasses the transformation of agricultural, marine and organic resources into food, feed, fuels, energy and materials, the bioeconomy should become a major new industry replacing oil-based products. However, policymakers take two main approaches to developing the bioeconomy. The first, biotech-oriented approach depicts the bioeconomy as a biotechnology subsector. The second, biomass-oriented approach (i) considers biomass transformation as its starting point, (ii) raises the issue of bioeconomy sustainability, and (iii) considers biotechnology as just one of many transformation technologies. The growing literature on defining the bioeconomy has not yet covered the articulation between biotechnology and bioeconomy. This paper fills this critical gap and provides policy recommendations depending on whether the goal is to develop biotechnology or to contribute to green growth and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit have often experienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind difficult social and ecological legacies. To understand the origins and outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied the framework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace the drivers and dynamics of forest governance surrounding a boom-bust sequence of industrial forest management in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U. S. history: the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. Our application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative tracing dynamics in political, institutional, and economic subsystems and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall system behavior (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global market changes drove transformative change in both forest governance (policy making) and forest management (practices), through creation and dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the systemic resilience provided by these leases was found in the analysis of industry responses to market volatility before and after Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts stabilized the Tongass system for a period of time, they fostered a growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial collapse and the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader lessons from the Tongass suggest that large-scale changes occurred only when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a systemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately resulted in catastrophic collapse of governance. This collapse resulted in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass reorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger social-ecological system of southeastern Alaska. Although this legacy has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the emergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable governance of the Tongass National Forest.},

It is key to Swedish forest politics and used to capture the essence of a sustainable way of managing forests. However, the ideas, institutions and practices comprising the model have not been comprehensively analyzed previously. Addressing this knowledge gap, we use frame analysis and a Pathways approach to investigate the underlying governance model, focusing on the way policy problems are addressed, goals, implementation procedures, outcomes and the resulting pathways to sustainability. We suggest that the institutionally embedded response to pressing sustainability challenges and increasing demands is expansion, inclusion and integration: more of everything. The more-of-everything pathway is influenced by ideas of ecological modernization and the optimistic view that existing resources can be increased. Our findings suggest that in effect it prioritizes the economic dimension of sustainability. While broadening out policy formulation it closes down the range of alternative outputs, a shortcoming that hampers its capacity to respond to current sustainability challenges. Consequently, there is a need for a broad public debate regarding not only the role of forests in future society, but also the operationalization of sustainable development.},

It is demonstrated here through textual analysis that Engels criticized not the entropy law itself but the extrapolation of this into the ?heat death theory of the universe? hypothesis. The historical debate surrounding this hypothesis is examined, showing that Engels and Marx remained consistent with the natural science of their day. This opens the way to the recognition that Marx's political economy was unique in the 19th century in incorporating thermodynamics into the core of its analysis, thus providing the foundations for an ecological economics. The materialist-dialectical view of classical Marxism led to a dynamic, open, contingent approach to the earth system, reflecting a general evolutionary perspective.},

These systems are characterised by complexity, giving rise to potential unintended consequences and trade-offs caused by actions aiming to facilitate a transition process. Yet, many of the analyses to date have been focusing on single and predominantly technological aspects of the bio-based economy. The main contribution of our work is to the development of an integrated understanding of potential future transition pathways, with the present paper focusing specifically on terrestrial biological resources derived from the forestry sector in Sweden. Desired change processes identified include a transition to diversified forest management, a structural change in the forestry industry to enable high-value added production, and increased political support for the bio-based economy concept. Hindrances identified include the ability to demonstrate added values for end consumers of novel biomass applications, and uncertainty linked to a perceived high level of polarisation in the forestry debate. The results outline how these different processes are interrelated, allowing for the identification of high order leverage points and interventions to facilitate a transition to a bio-based economy.},

To support evidence-based decision-making in this context, this paper presents the results from an integrated assessment of sustainability goal interactions. Links between the bio-based economy, the 2030 Agenda, and the so-called strong sustainability paradigm were explored in a regional-scale case. The analysis focused primarily on developments in the forestry and energy sectors. Direct trade-offs and synergies as well as broader systemic impacts were identified. The results show how goals from the bio-based economy, 2030 Agenda and strong sustainability paradigm are mutually interacting. Positive interactions were found within two clusters of goals, offering coherent and synergetic transition pathways within these. The first cluster encompasses developments toward intensified forestry, renewable energy, and closed-loop production systems. The second pathway supports diversified forestry and protection of critical natural capital. However, while internally coherent, trade-offs were identified between these goal clusters, demonstrating the difficulty in simultaneously making progress on goals belonging to different sustainability agendas. The results also stress the need for disaggregation and long-term assessments to identify trade-offs and synergies. Finally, the analysis highlights the theoretical potential but practical challenges of implementing the bio-based economy and 2030 Agenda in a way that adheres to strong sustainability. The analytical framework used in the present study may be adapted and applied to other decision-making contexts. It is particularly useful in settings characterized by uncertainty and unstructured problem spaces.},

These calculations are implemented using two different models comprising one with labour and capital as the classical production factors and one where we introduce patent stock as an additional factor of production. In the former, we further differentiate between a scenario where all production factors are mobile and one with sector-specific capital. In the latter analysis, we measure the impact of innovation-targeting policy action for sectoral output. Positive Rybczynski effects of patents and high-skilled workers are strongest in knowledge-intensive sectors, while other sectors contract. The introduction of patents as a further production factor has only minor influence on the Rybczynski effects of other factors.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses interactions between technological innovation systems (TIS) and wider “context structures”. While TIS studies have always considered various kinds of contextual influences, we suggest that the TIS framework can be further strengthened by a more elaborated conceptualization of TIS context structures and TIS–context interactions. For that purpose, we identify and discuss four especially important types of context structures: technological, sectorial, geographical and political. For each of these, we provide examples of different ways in which context structures can interact with a focal TIS and how our understanding of TIS dynamics is enhanced by considering them explicitly. Lessons for analysts are given and a research agenda is outlined.},

  abstract = {Organizational networks had a strong influence on the diffusion of green knowledge within the Swedish pulp-and-paper industry from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. The environmental adaptations made by this industrial sector were not merely the result of a corporate initiative or of the response by firms or industries to environmental regulation. An examination of the innovation-system approach that was used to further the industry's environmental goals reveals that the knowledge and technology development underpinning the project depended on a network of diverse actors. Within this network, the semi-governmental Institute for Water and Air Protection, working with a consulting company, was a critical generator and intermediary of knowledge. Thus, the success of the project was largely due to the Institute's balanced relations with government and industry.},

While existing reviews of agroforestry adoption focus on government policy, there is increasing interest from, and opportunities for, non-state actors to accelerate agroforestry adoption. The purpose of this critical review is to identify points of entry for non-state actors to increase smallholder incentives for agroforestry adoption in low and middle income countries. We identify opportunities for non-state actors to address key market failures in all stages of the agroforestry system. We find that non-state actors have advantages of proximity and institutional knowledge that provide opportunities for direct and indirect intervention to increase agroforestry adoption.},

This innovation for sustainable rice cultivation was developed and diffused without relying on market mechanisms yet has been adopted by millions of farmers worldwide. To further our understanding of economic mechanisms beyond markets, we revisit Polanyi's distinction between markets, reciprocity, redistribution, and subsistence. This distinction helps to situate markets in a broader economic context and helps to understand how mechanisms for market exchange intersect with other types of economies in ways that can either positively or negatively affect sustainability.},

At the global scale, however, bio-economies are diverse, with sectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, as well as science and education. In this study, we developed a typology of bio-economies based on country-specific characteristics, and describe five different bio-economy types with varying degrees of importance in the primary and the high-tech sector. We also matched the bio-economy types against the foci of their bio-economy strategies and evaluated their sustainability performance. Overall, high-tech bio-economies seem to be more diversified in terms of their policy strategies while the policies of those relying on the primary sector are focused on bioenergy and high-tech industries. In terms of sustainability performance, indicators suggest that diversified high-tech economies have experienced a slight sustainability improvement, especially in terms of resource consumption. Footprints remain, however, at the highest levels compared to all other bio-economy types with large amounts of resources and raw materials being imported from other countries. These results highlight the necessity of developed high-tech bio-economies to further decrease their environmental footprint domestically and internationally, and the importance of biotechnology innovation transfer after critical and comprehensive sustainability assessments.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the capacities of Iran as a developing country to attain the full meaning of sustainability and explores the achievability of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through a conceptual system dynamics (SD) model. From one perspective, investigating complex systems such as sustainable development requires research methods that take into account the dynamic interdependencies among the 17 SDGs. From another perspective, although achieving SDGs are a universal agenda for all nations, the evaluation of each country's accomplishments has to be based on its national capacities and challenges in the way of implementing these goals. Therefore, as a response to this research agenda, the presented conceptual SD model of sustainable development consists of 14 causal loops that highlight the direct and indirect interdependencies among the SDGs. Moreover, based on the proposed SD model, it is concluded that not only the obstacles in the way of attaining several SDGs in Iran, namely as 1) regional conflicts and environmental concerns, 2) internal conflicts of interests among key stakeholders, 3) sanctions, and 4) absence of updated data and credible evaluation mechanism, makes it impossible for the country to reach the preordained milestones of specific SDGs, but also they would eventually affect the achievements of other goals badly. Furthermore, the presented study reveals that I) SDG 9 and SDG 17, II) SDG 8, III) SDG 12, and IV) SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 15, respectively have the highest influence on achieving the desired behavior of the system in the context of Iran. This study provides valuable insights to the local managers in Iran in designing a set of prioritized policies for mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda into national plans and for the policymakers in other developing countries, creates a profound understanding of the systematic relationships among SDGs.},

By drawing on existing innovation system concepts and recent elaborations on the globalization of innovation, we develop a multi-scalar conceptualization of innovation systems. Two key mechanisms are introduced and elaborated: the generation of resources in multi-locational subsystems and the establishment of structural couplings among them in a global innovation system (GIS). Based on this conceptualization, we introduce a typology of four generic GIS configurations, building on the innovation mode and valuation system in different industry types. The analytical framework is illustrated with insights from four emerging clean-tech industries. We state that a comprehensive GIS perspective is instrumental for developing a more explanatory stance in the innovation system literature and developing policy interventions that reflect the increasing spatial complexity in the innovation process.},

This frames the sustainability problem as an inefficiency to be overcome through a techno-knowledge fix. Here ecological sustainability means a benign eco-efficient productivity using resources which are renewable, reproducible and therefore sustainable. The KBBE narrative has been elaborated by European Technology Platforms in the agri-food-forestry-biofuels sectors, whose proposals shape research priorities. These inform policy agendas for the neoliberalization of both nature and knowledge, especially through intellectual property. In these ways, the KBBE can be understood as a new political-economic strategy for sustainable capital. This strategy invests great expectations for unlocking the productive potential of natural resources through a techno-knowledge fix. Although eco-efficiency is sometimes equated with biological productivity, commercial success will be dependent upon new combinations of “living” and “dead” labour.},

Current research shows that perennial intercropping systems such as agroforestry may be a feasible alternative. Based on studies during the establishment of edible forest gardens in 12 participating farms in Sweden, this paper explores the potential of utilizing multi-strata designs for food production in temperate, high-income countries. Design and species composition of such gardens, types of food they provide, and how they would best fit into the present landscape are discussed. Factors for success and major problems related to the establishment are shared. Potential benefits were found to be closely related to a thorough analysis of the social and ecological contexts before establishment. Characteristics of the site and goals of the garden need to guide species and design choices. If forest garden approaches to food production should contribute to more than local self-sufficiency, the gardens need to increase in scale. Marginal lands and transitions areas between different land uses may be appropriate. Large knowledge gaps concerning potential production, social and economic benefits, and agronomic issues were identified.},

To gain a better understanding of forest owner decision-making and its implications for forest land-use change, we develop a forest owner functional typology based on a meta-analysis of quantitative and qualitative information about forest owners and their decision-making strategies across the developed world. From this typology, we develop an index of forest owner sustainability. We find nine broad forest owner functional types: industrial productionist, non-industrial productionist, for-profit recreationist, for-profit multi-objective, non-profit multi-objective, recreationalist, species conservationist, ecosystem conservationist and passive owner. These owner types align along three gradients representing (1) their economic focus, (2) the intensity of their management practices and (3) the type of goods and services they provide (private vs. public). We also find that multi-objective and conservationist owners generally practise the most sustainable forms of forest management and industrial productionists the least sustainable in terms of triple bottom line sustainability. Supracontinental land owner typologies of this kind can be useful in assisting international policy making and in developing resource management programmes. We suggest that future studies should investigate forest owner typologies in the developing world, forest owner information-sharing networks, and the ways in which forest owners learn and adapt to environmental change.},

We translated the policy documents of Finland into scenarios including the quantitative demands for FES, representing: the national forest strategy (NFS), the biodiversity strategy (BDS), and the bioeconomy strategy (BES). We simulated a Finland-wide systematic sample of forest stands with alternative management regimes and climate change. Finally, we used multi-objective optimization to identify the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario and analysed their long-term effects on FES. The NFS scenario proved to be the most multifunctional, targeting the highest number of FES, while the BES had the lowest FES targets. However, the NFS was strongly oriented towards the value chain of wood and bioenergy and had a dominating economic growth target, which caused strong within-policy conflicts and hindered reaching biodiversity targets. The BDS and BES scenarios were instead more consistent but showed either sustainability gaps in terms of providing timber resources (BDS) or no improvements in forest biodiversity (BES). All policy scenarios resulted in forest management programs dominated by continuous cover forestry, set-aside areas, and intensive management zones, with proportions depending on the policy focus. Our results highlight for the first time the conflicts among national sectoral policies in terms of management requirements and effects on forest multifunctionality. The outcomes provide leverage points for policymakers to increase coherence among future policies and improve implementation of multiple uses of forests.},

  abstract = {To implement policies about sustainable forest management (SFM), different international and national concepts have appeared. The Polish Promotional Forest Complex (PFC) concept was introduced in the 1990s. We analysed the emergence of this concept, its objectives and establishment, and its perceived outcomes on the ground. We conducted a literature review and sent out a questionnaire to all forest management units involved with the established 19 PFCs in Poland. The results indicate that the management in PFCs largely satisfied its objectives. However, in the context of SFM, this management was unbalanced to the advantage of the ecological dimension while paying little attention to either social or economic sustainability. This finding correlated with the SFM principle not being clearly defined in the policies for the PFC concept. Our results thus indicate that PFCs became neither pioneers in implementing pro-ecological forestry nor exemplary models for other Polish forests. We conclude that sustainable development as a process towards the goal of sustainability in countries in transition requires time and a change in attitudes among stakeholders that reflect both SFM policy and the transition from government to governance.

Our approach enables us to identify and document the diffusion of 29 disruptive technologies across firms and labor markets in the U.S. Five stylized facts emerge from our data. First, the locations where technologies are developed that later disrupt businesses are geographically highly concentrated, even more so than overall patenting. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of new jobs related to them grows, they gradually spread across space. While initial hiring is concentrated in high-skilled jobs, over time the mean skill level in new positions associated with the technologies declines, broadening the types of jobs that adopt a given technology. At the same time, the geographic diffusion of low-skilled positions is significantly faster than higher-skilled ones, so that the locations where initial discoveries were made retain their leading positions among high-paying positions for decades. Finally, these technology hubs are more likely to arise in areas with universities and high skilled labor pools.},

Given that achieving sustainable development ["Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs"—(WCED in Our common future, Oxford University Press, New York, 1987)] is core to the attainment and maintenance of citizens' well-being, and increasingly understood to require major transformations in integrated social, technological and ecological systems (Sachs et al. in The decade of action for the sustainable development goals: sustainable development report 2021, Cambridge, 2021), it follows that governments have a significant role in shaping transformations. Muted progress on long-standing social, environmental, and economic challenges alongside spiralling public budgets and intergenerational debt suggests, however, that public governance systems are inadequate to facilitate the transformations urgently required. Conceptualising the practice of public decision-making as a complex system, this paper investigates whether known influences on public decision-makers can be linked to Meadows’ (Leverage points: places to intervene in a system, Sustainability Institute, North Charleston, 1999) leverage point framework. Finding meaningful connections, it further explores how the leverage point framework can be employed to engage decision-making influences as enablers of desirable public outcomes. It is contended that shifting decision-makers’ focus one step beyond currently prevalent leverage points will set in motion the transformations in governance required to facilitate sustainable development.},

  abstract = {Any reflections on an eventual transition towards a degrowth society have to take into account the current crisis in the dominant system and question whether the latter will be able to grow again or not. In order for the latter to happen, the role played by technological innovation is crucial. This paper starts by reconsidering Georgescu-Roegen’s definition of Promethean Techniques and Tainter’s principle of Declining Marginal Returns, with the aim of providing e within the common framework of the theory of complex systems - a sound theoretical basis for the analysis of the rise and fall of complex societies. The main purpose is to verify whether, after the last Promethean revolution, a “Great Wave” emerged or not. The second part of the paper presents an initial investigation into this hypothesis, using Total Factor Productivity growth as an indicator of (marginal) returns on innovation (1750e2015). Despite the limitations implicit in the use of this indicator, data show three cycles of innovation, corresponding to the first, second and third industrial revolutions, but of different magnitude and duration. In particular, the whole cycle that began with the first industrial revolution in England around 1750, reached a peak in the U.S. in the nineteen-thirties and later declined, following a trend that basically confirms the Great Wave hypothesis. Even recent innovations resulting from the ICT revolution, however considerable, do not seem capable of counteracting this long-term trend. Data on returns on innovation seem, therefore, to be coherent with evidence provided by research in other fields (energy, mineral resources, agriculture, health, education and scientific research), showing that advanced capitalist societies have entered a phase of declining marginal returns - or involuntary degrowth - with possible major effects on the system’s capacity to maintain its present institutional framework.},

Whether this trend will persist, and how biological and economic trends feature it form crucial issues to green economy challenges and C sequestration. The present screening of Forest Europe 2015 statistics explored the features, inertia and limits of this expansion, and its relationships with countries’ development, forest management and trade, intense in this area of the world. Persisting footprint of past demographic pressure on forests was identified, with opposed traces on their area and growing stock density. Steady growing stock (GS) increases, proportional to GS, not density-limited, and sustained by forest area increases, supported the view of an inflationary forest dynamic. Economic development and liberalism fostered both forest exploitation and production, yielding no significant impact on GS changes. Wood exports exerted a tension on forest exploitation and GS changes, thus lowering GS inflation but providing a resource security margin in the face of expected climate threats. Conflicting a common view, GS inflation and moderate felling-to-increment ratios make increased use of wood resources and C sequestration reconcilable, and GS expansion timely for ongoing EU forest policy processes. Anticipated adverse impacts of ongoing climate change were not clearly identified in these statistics.},

This article conceptualises demand-oriented innovation policies and their links to societal challenges. We differentiate demand and need, and highlight different forms of demand articulation. Then, we characterise three ideal-typical policies that relate to demand: traditional innovation policy, sector-specific policy, and challenge-oriented policy. These three ideal-types are discussed focussing on output legitimacy, input legitimacy, and operational requirements. This discussion highlights the specific challenges and opportunities of demand-oriented innovation policies and allows to derive a set of recommendations to increase the effectiveness of such policies.},

European and other national and global standardization schemes for biofuels also include certain minimum GHG emission reduction among the requirements to be met. Assessments of the GHG performance of biofuels are complex due to the complexities of physical, chemical, and biological conversion processes, feedstock diversity, and variability in site-specific environmental conditions. Differences may also arise in analytical approaches, including in how direct and indirect land use change is accounted for. Current production of first-generation ethanol in Sweden, based on wheat, causes relatively low GHG emissions, whereas a future expansion may cause increased emissions from changes in land use and less optimal utilization of by-products. Such negative impacts may be avoided by an introduction and expansion of second-generation ethanol based on lignocellulosic feedstock (e.g., straw, short rotation coppice, and forest residues), which eventually could become the major feedstock in ethanol production. This transition to low, indirect impact ethanol systems creates an opening for a significant expansion of ethanol in the transport sector without compromising the sizeable climate benefits and sustainable resource exploitation.

The research method involved comparative qualitative case study analysis through action research. We found that the governance approach in The Netherlands focusses on co-creating a long-term vision that informs for short-term action, on facilitating bottom-up regional clusters and promoting radical innovation through cooperation between vested players and frontrunners. Finland adopts a more traditional, top-down governance strategy, focussing on the shorter-term economic opportunities and incremental innovation that keep the overall structure of existing industries intact. We conclude that the Dutch government acts as a facilitator, while the Finnish government acts more as a director of the transition.

What are the drivers and motivation for companies' adoption of eco-innovation? How could results from the literature help define a conceptual framework of eco-innovation drivers and motivations? To address these questions, a systematic review was conducted. After defining inclusion and exclusion search criteria, the search of peer reviewed papers from the ISI Web of Knowledge database was systematically applied. The final database included 96 full papers, of which 35 matched the specific target of analysis that focused at: i) Eco-innovation concepts and approaches; ii) Methods and main findings; and iii) Drivers and motivation for adoption of eco-innovation. Results indicated that there is a growing interest in this concept, not only from a managerial but also from an academic perspective (54\% of papers were published after 2010). Various methods are used in the selected papers, and evidence shows that leading firms are protagonists in developing new technologies. Although specific or one-off actions was enough to recognize eco-innovation in some cases, to boost performance companies need to improve the focus in eco-innovation as an explicit goal of their strategies. This paper contributes by pointing out internal factors that companies can manage in order to fully adopt eco-innovation, going beyond mere compliance of external factors over which companies have little or no control. Based on the systematic review, this article draws propositions and develops a conceptual model for further empirical research on eco-innovation.},

  abstract = {There is currently a marked interest in do-it-yourself culture and sharing of skills, tools and spaces, manifesting in maker spaces, tool libraries and open workshops for remaking furniture, electronics, bicycles or clothing. This paper explores the phenomenon of ‘Bike Kitchens’, do-it-yourself bicycle repair studios run on a non-profit basis. The Bike Kitchen in Malmo€, Sweden, is used as a case study involving interviews with key persons and users of that Bicycle Kitchen and on-site observations. The exploration of the Bike Kitchen is situated in a wider theoretical discussion around technology in relation to degrowth. Two theoretical perspectives are used, firstly, Illich's (1973) notion of tools for conviviality, meaning tools that enable citizens to reconquer practical knowledge for autonomy and creativity rather than being confined to commercial relations, and secondly, forms of non-capitalist relations. It is argued that the Bike Kitchen is an example of democratisation of technology in practice e a social innovation to make low-cost technology, tools and know-how easily available to anyone. The concept of the Bike Kitchen is a way to develop and cultivate conviviality, i.e. a social and spatial infrastructure e a space for convivial tools.},

  abstract = {This study aims to reveal how innovation ecosystems can organise value creation without a focal firm or a platform during the pre-phases of innovation. This has been scarcely researched hitherto; therefore, a participatory action research approach is used to reveal essential phenomena emerging in collaboration with research participants. An extended approach for innovation ecosystems to create value in society is hereby revealed beyond the coordination done by a focal firm or a platform, as noted in previous research. The study was conducted from September 2017 to June 2018 in a port in the Baltic Sea. Four enterprises participated in representing complementary activities for value creation in the pre-phases of establishing a new offshore wind park within the wind-energy innovation ecosystem.The findings are summarised using in the 'EcoValue BMI' model. The findings highlight the essential role of value proposition in innovation ecosystems in focusing and structuring the direction of complementary independent initiatives for value creation, as noted in the middle of the model. All participating enterprises could identify the overall ecosystem value proposition. This insight into the overall value proposition is realised by organising collaborative business model innovation (BMI) to set horizontal innovation directions for exploration and exploitation of interfaces and flow among ecosystem participants for cleaner energy production. Further research is required to verify and enhance the 'EcoValue BMI' findings through new research conducted in similar large innovation ecosystems without a focal firm or a platform to coordinate the innovation ecosystem for value creation in society.},

  abstract = {Using annual data from the thirteenth century to the present, we show that improved long run economic performance has occurred primarily through a decline in the rate and frequency of shrinking, rather than through an increase in the rate of growing. Indeed, as economic performance has improved over time, the short run rate of growing has typically declined rather than increased. Most analysis of the process of economic development has hitherto focused on increasing the rate of growing. Here, we focus on understanding the forces making for a reduction in the rate of shrinking, drawing a distinction between proximate and ultimate factors. The main proximate factors considered are (1) structural change (2) technological change (3) demographic change and (4) the changing incidence of warfare. We conclude with a consideration of institutional change as the key ultimate factor behind the reduction in shrinking.},

  abstract = {Many factors such as fossil resource scarcity and new technological developments have brought the bioeconomy, an economy based on the use of biomass or bio-based processes, into the focus. Although many authors and national strategies view bioeconomy innovations as a key for a sustainable economy transition, a conceptual framework that describes innovation types (ITs) in the bioeconomy profoundly is lacking, thus challenging the successful development of technology and innovation management (TIM) strategies and research. Against this backdrop, we aim to fill this gap by conceptualizing four ITs specific to the bioeconomy, namely I) Substitute Products, II) New (bio-based) Processes, III) New (bio-based) Products, and IV) New Behavior. These types are discussed against existing frameworks dealing with sustainability-oriented innovations (SOIs) emphasizing the particularities of the bioeconomy. Moreover, we derive implications for each type as commercialization challenges that are discussed with bioeconomy experts from natural sciences and economics to improve the external validity of the proposed typology. In total, this is the first approach to conceptualize innovation types in the bioeconomy, filling the structural void in bioeconomy research and innovation management. The here presented typology can be applied as a guiding principle for future research avenues, monitoring the evolution of the bioeconomy as well to design innovation strategies by researchers, policy makers and managers.},

Through its critical and interdisciplinary practice and the integration of economic and ecological knowledge in the valuation and management of natural resources, ecological economics develops a critical assessment of the growth paradigm. The controversy between green growth and sustainable degrowth continues in science and politics. Degrowth, convincing to ecologists, is not yet widely accepted in economics and policy practice. A consequence is the experimentation with contradicting forms of resource management in the sustainability process.},

This has direct consequences on consumption patterns and consumption-based carbon footprints, resulting in carbon inequality. Due to persistent inequality, millions of people still live in poverty today. On the basis of global expenditure data, we compute country- and expenditure-specific per capita carbon footprints with unprecedented details. We show that they can reach several hundred tons of CO2 per year, while the majority of people living below poverty lines have yearly carbon footprints of less than 1\,tCO2. Reaching targets under United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1, lifting more than one billion people out of poverty, leads to only small relative increases in global carbon emissions of 1.6–2.1\% or less. Nevertheless, carbon emissions in low- and lower-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa can more than double as an effect of poverty alleviation. To ensure global progress on poverty alleviation without overshooting climate targets, high-emitting countries need to reduce their emissions substantially.},

Sweden adopts a holistic perspective of the forest sector, where forestry and forest industries are perceived as a well-integrated economic branch. Forestry is expected to deliver raw material to forest industries, at the same time creating good preconditions for profitable forest management. Forest owners are given large freedom to act according to market signals and their own household needs, while the resulting intensive forest management cumulatively leads to a significant contribution to the country's welfare. Lithuania, in contrast, lacks an integrated sector perspective, forestry and forest industries being regarded as two separate realms. Private forest property rights are severely constrained by numerous legislative stipulations, leading to a significant reduction of economic value in production forests. On top of that, thirty percent of private owners face additional restrictions through forestland zoning, leading to further substantial loss of economic value. We suggest several measures for improving the economic forest sustainability in Lithuania, where a genuine national forest program could serve as a suitable bearing medium.},

We present the first detailed account on how modern forest management has transformed a beech (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forest landscape in southern Sweden. Specifically, we analyse changes in forest distribution, composition and structure since 1840 at Skabersjö estate and discuss the implications for forest biodiversity. Skabersjö estate is a representative example for the development of semi-open wood pastures into managed dense forests for timber production. This development was part of a long-term process during which changing socio-economic conditions initiated a pervasive change of the Swedish forest landscape, including increasing total forest areas and timber stocks but decreasing relative shares of broadleaved trees. The successful transition to net reforestation starting in the mid-nineteenth century benefitted from a new scientific approach to forest management and the banning of forest grazing. At Skabersjö estate, the introduction of organised forestry resulted in steadily increasing timber yields, but the associated changes in forest structure and composition also changed habitat conditions for many species associated to temperate broadleaved trees. A strong decline of old beech trees has resulted in a lower habitat availability for specialised epiphytic and saproxylic species.},

A forest sector trade model is updated to a new base year (2016), and then employed to analyze the consequences of a more intense use of bioenergy and increased forest conservation in Sweden. These scenarios are assessed individually and in combination. A particularly interesting market impact is that bioenergy promotion and forest conservation tend to have opposite effects on forest industry by-product prices. Moreover, combining the two policies mitigates the forest industry by-product price increase compared to the case where only the bioenergy-promoting policy is implemented. Namely, the energy using sector (heat and power) is less negatively affected in terms of increased feedstock prices if bioenergy demand targets are accompanied by increased forest conservation. This effect is due to increasing pulpwood prices, which reduces pulp, paper and board production, and in turn mitigates the competition for the associated by-products. Overall, the paper illustrates the complexity of the forest raw material market, and the importance of considering demand and supply responses within and between sectors in energy and forest policy decision-making.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, skeptics of the reality and significance of anthropogenic climate change have frequently accused climate scientists of ‘‘alarmism’’: of over-interpreting or overreacting to evidence of human impacts on the climate system. However, the available evidence suggests that scientists have in fact been conservative in their projections of the impacts of climate change. In particular, we discuss recent studies showing that at least some of the key attributes of global warming from increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of the physical science, by Working Group I. We also note the less frequent manifestation of over-prediction of key characteristics of climate in such assessments. We suggest, therefore, that scientists are biased not toward alarmism but rather the reverse: toward cautious estimates, where we define caution as erring on the side of less rather than more alarming predictions. We call this tendency ‘‘erring on the side of least drama (ESLD).’’ We explore some cases of ESLD at work, including predictions of Arctic ozone depletion and the possible disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and suggest some possible causes of this directional bias, including adherence to the scientific norms of restraint, objectivity, skepticism, rationality, dispassion, and moderation. We conclude with suggestions for further work to identify and explore ESLD.},

Despite this, there seems to be little consensus concerning what bioeconomy actually implies. Consequently, this paper seeks to enhance our understanding of what the notion of bioeconomy means by exploring the origins, uptake, and contents of the term “bioeconomy” in the academic literature. Firstly, we perform a bibliometric analysis that highlights that the bioeconomy research community is still rather fragmented and distributed across many different fields of science, even if natural and engineering sciences take up the most central role. Secondly, we carry out a literature review that identifies three visions of the bioeconomy. The bio-technology vision emphasises the importance of bio-technology research and application and commercialisation of bio-technology in different sectors of the economy. The bio-resource vision focuses on processing and upgrading of biological raw materials, as well as on the establishment of new value chains. Finally, the bio-ecology vision highlights sustainability and ecological processes that optimise the use of energy and nutrients, promote biodiversity, and avoid monocultures and soil degradation.},

In the first issue of the journal Ecosystems, the field of historical ecology, which focuses on the historical development of ecosystems, was prominently positioned with the papers of Foster and others (Ecosystems 1:96–119, 1998) and Fuller and others (Ecosystems 1:76–95, 1998). Starting from these two contributions, we (1) discuss how anthropogenic activities affect ecosystems and their development, (2) outline how land use can be assessed in ecosystem research, and we (3) discuss what the consequences of a historical perspective for our understanding of ecosystems are. We conclude by stating that whereas land-use intensity over time is an ecologically highly relevant parameter to grasp, the availability, quality, and characteristics of historical sources often restrict the analyses. In order to make optimal use of the sources and methods available and to strengthen this field of research and also increase its societal relevance, we suggest building interdisciplinary teams from a very early project phase on. Core task for these teams will be to jointly define research questions considering source availability, and including and merging modeling and experimental approaches in the study design. We propose that adopting a landscape perspective in historical ecology would provide a helpful framework and valuable background for such novel integrated analyses.},

  abstract = {Total factor productivity (TFP) is a central concept in the mainstream analysis of economic growth. Using aggregate production functions, economists estimate the shares of economic growth explained by increases in capital, labor, and (in some applications) natural resource inputs. The residual of unexplained growth is then ascribed to ?disembodied? technological advance or TFP. This article develops a radical ecological-economic critique of TFP analysis. The critique uses Marxist theory to synthesize relevant nonmainstream perspectives including ecological economics (especially Georgescu-Roegen's critique of the aggregate production function and Daly's rejection of the mainstream ?circular flow? vision of the economy), neo-Schumpetarian criticisms of disembodied technological change, and the ?identification? critique which shows that TFP estimates merely capture the accounting identity between income and value added. From a Marxist perspective, TFP theory's false dematerialization of production technology reflects capitalism's alienation of workers and communities from necessary conditions of production.},

Many documents do not come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machine-learning algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and one supervised method. Experimental results carried out on top of twenty datasets show that YAKE! significantly outperforms other unsupervised methods on texts of different sizes, languages, and domains.},

We relate our argument to recent empirical trends in productivity dynamics and innovative activities. These suggest that an innovation slowdown is taking place and, consequently, that a renewed interest in the (re-)direction—rather than on the intensity of innovative activities—is key to the design of R\&I policy capable to tackle current challenges. We use the evidence to build a schematic theoretical framework to inform policy design, and we outlined the defining features of our proposed policy style.},

Recent empirical analyses of the European Union bioeconomies have adopted a definition of bioeconomy which also encompasses activities in \&ldquo;hybrid\&rdquo; sectors; inputs for these sectors include not only biomass, but also a relevant share of other materials. We use the same definition to assess the features and evolution of the bioeconomy in Norway. The Norwegian bioeconomy is complex, both in terms of sectoral composition and of technological development. Our analysis builds upon national statistics on value added and employment as well as on expert interviews, aimed at detecting Norway\&rsquo;s peculiarities in terms of biomass utilisation. We find that the Norwegian bioeconomy has strongly increased its productivity in recent years. An astonishingly high peak in productivity is registered for fishing and aquaculture, whose value added has evolved massively; at the same time, pharmaceuticals are experiencing a dramatic shift toward bio-based production. General trends in the country\&rsquo;s bioeconomy have thus emerged from different transformation pathways across sectors. Our empirical analysis leads to formulating a general reflection about the definition of bioeconomy and its implications for socioeconomic quantitative studies.},

However, a challengeoriented approach requires specific public sector capacities to coordinate and provide directionality, while having an innovation ecosystem with sufficient scientific and technological capabilities to address the grand societal challenges effectively. From this perspective, a challenge-oriented policy is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and the literature has only recently started investigating the territorial differences. The current paper proposes a composite index to assess REgional Societal Challenges-Oriented REadiness (RE-SCORE). An exploratory experimental application is conducted to examine and compare Italian regions facing four selected societal challenges (SCs): bioeconomy, climate change, health and inclusive, innovative and reflective societies. The findings show that the Italian regional readiness to address SCs is highly heterogeneous, going beyond the ‘traditional’ North-South divide. The index allows us to benchmark regional capacities for comparative analysis and to identify possible interregional synergies around specific SCs. This approach could be used in other European countries and at the European level to assess the regional readiness to tackle SCs.},

The central features of technological systems are economic competence (the ability to develop and exploit new business opportunities), clustering of resources, and institutional infrastructure. A technological system is defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific economic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology. Technological systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordinary goods and services. In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass, such networks can be transformed into development blocks, i.e. synergistic clusters of firms and technologies which give rise to new business opportunities.},

Systems consist of components, relationships among these, and their characteristics or attributes.

First, what is the appropriate level of analysis for the purpose at hand? It matters, for example, whether we are interested in a certain technology, product, set of related products, a competence bloc, a particular cluster of activities or firms, or the science and technology base generally—and for what geographic area, as well as for what time period. The choice of components and system boundaries depends on this, as does the type of interaction among components to be analyzed. The attributes or features of the system components that come into focus also depend on the choice of level of analysis. The second and closely related issue is how to determine the population, i.e. delineate the system and identify the actors and/or components. What are the key relationships that need to be captured so that the important interaction takes place within the system rather than outside? The third issue is how to measure the performance of the system. What is to be measured, and how can performance be measured at the system level rather than at component level?},

  abstract = {This chapter covers methodological issues related to estimation, testing and computation for models involving structural changes. Our aim is to review developments as they relate to econometric applications based on linear models. Substantial advances have been made to cover models at a level of generality that allow a host of interesting practical applications. These include models with general stationary regressors and errors that can exhibit temporal dependence and heteroskedasticity, models with trending variables and possible unit roots and cointegrated models, among others. Advances have been made pertaining to computational aspects of constructing estimates, their limit distributions, tests for structural changes, and methods to determine the number of changes present. A variety of topics are covered. The first part summarizes and updates developments described in an earlier review, Perron (2006), with the exposition following heavily that of Perron (2008). Additions are included for recent developments: testing for common breaks, models with endogenous regressors (emphasizing that simply using least-squares is preferable over instrumental variables methods), quantile regressions, methods based on Lasso, panel data models, testing for changes in forecast accuracy, factors models and methods of inference based on a continuous records asymptotic framework. Our focus is on the so-called off-line methods whereby one wants to retrospectively test for breaks in a given sample of data and form confidence intervals about the break dates. The aim is to provide the readers with an overview of methods that are of direct usefulness in practice as opposed to issues that are mostly of theoretical interest.},

It draws on an on-going research project concerning inclusive innovation in forest-based bioenergy and biogas in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Italy. The goal is to explore how local governance impacts on inclusive innovation processes and triple bottom sustainability of bioenergy development in Emilia Romagna and, ultimately, to contribute to the debate on the bioeconomy. It thus compares the case of biogas and forest-based bioenergy production. The study adopts an analytical framework called Grounded Innovation (GRIP) and the local governance approach. The study uses qualitative methods and particularly semi-structured interviews and governance analysis. The key results show different outcomes on both inclusive innovation and triple bottom-line dimensions. Biogas has not fostered inclusiveness and triple bottom line sustainability benefits, contrary to forest-based bioenergy. The findings indicate that the minor role of local actors, particularly municipalities, in favour of industrial and national interests may jeopardise the sustainability of biobased industries. Besides, policies limited to financial incentives may lead to a land-acquisition rush, unforeseen local environmental effects and exacerbate conflicts.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the case of bioenergy development in Norway - drawing on Hedmark county located on the borders with Sweden - from a social, economic and environmental perspective (triple bottom line). Since 2008, the number of forest-based bioenergy plants increased rapidly, following the introduction of the wood-chips scheme and the high local expectations of its benefits for rural development. Obstacles to its continuous sustainable development have subsequently been increasing. Therefore, the goal of the study is to investigate the causal processes of bioenergy development to understand what threatens its triple bottom line sustainability. The study does so by employing qualitative system dynamics (i.e. causal loop diagram) and using interviews with local actors to elaborate on studies that look at the influence of power, institutions and expectations on the transition processes. Results show that the local actors' positive perceptions of the benefits of bioenergy mainly drove its initial development, but that conflicting local interests, power relations, and market dynamics now threaten these initially positive perceptions.},

Following a quasi-chronological pattern, our exploration provides an overview of the DfS field, categorising the design approaches developed in the past decades under four innovation levels: Product, Product-Service System, Spatio-Social and Socio-Technical System. As a result, we propose an evolutionary framework and map the reviewed DfS approaches onto this framework. The proposed framework synthesizes the evolution of the DfS field, showing how it has progressively expanded from a technical and product-centric focus towards large scale system level changes in which sustainability is understood as a socio-technical challenge. The framework also shows how the various DfS approaches contribute to particular sustainability aspects and visualises linkages, overlaps and complementarities between these approaches.},

  abstract = {Scholars in the innovation system literature are increasingly paying attention to the issue of the directionality of sustainability transformations (Lindner et al. 2016; Scordato, Bugge, and Fevolden 2017; Schot and Kanger 2018) and how innovation ought to be geared towards particular visions of sustainable futures in what has been labelled as a normative turn of innovation system research (Schlaile et al. 2017). However, with few exceptions (Urmetzer et al. 2018), the literature has remained rather theoretical and its empirical applications largely unexplored. Using historical data on Swedish innovations, this paper investigates the historical transition to bioeconomy in Sweden, questioning the extent to which such transition is built around innovations in the forest-industry. The networks of innovations from SWINNO show a clear dominance of innovations coming from the machinery and equipment sector as well as chemicals but where innovations to and from the forest industry are still in an infant stage. All in all, the paper shows that Sweden is anchored in a resource-based vision of the bioeconomy, aiming at converting bioresources into new products, reducing waste, CO2 emissions and energy consumption. But has not fully embraced the potential of transformation of the forest industry to become a central piece in the path towards a stronger bioeconomy, by adopting a wider transformative strategy that embraces both the bioresource as well as bioecology vision of the forest-based bioeconomy and supports upstream innovations.},

However, information on how to access such funding affects firms' decision to expand their business strategy. This paper investigates the effect of information about financing tools on the adoption of Circular Economy business activities by exploring whether the better-informed firms are ‘greener’ and what influences such decision through a switching endogenous regressor model to account for endogeneity and selectivity bias. Data on European SMEs is combined with country-specific characteristics and econometric results indicate that better informed firms are by 65 percentage points more likely to adopt an activity promoting Circular Economy, highlighting that awareness about funding tools is crucial for sustainability transition. Evidence advocates for mainstreaming information regarding funding sources to pave the way towards green growth. A rebound effect regarding the use of renewables is observed whilst evidence points towards the rejection of Porter Hypothesis. Policy makers should target in fostering a greener business environment for the firms that engage in Circular Economy practices through increased information on funding options. Findings are also pertinent to the ongoing discussion and policy agenda around acceleration of the transition to a greener European Economy.},

  abstract = {Forest policy has developed from single to multiple objectives. This requires a transition from traditional sectoral planning to more open, multi-stakeholder approaches that take into account all dimensions of sustainability across entire landscapes and even regions. Comparisons of regions with different landscape histories and governance legacies can support collaborative learning. Following Patsy Healy's and Frances Cleaver's approaches, we compare institutional strategies and constraints for collaborative territorial planning in Canada and Sweden by focusing on two case study regions in steep urban-rural gradients. Both regions are facing severe challenges after a long focus on forest staples resources. To cope with the transition towards multiple objectives, efforts towards collaborative learning inspired by the Model Forest landscape approach were made. The Canadian case study had some quick successes because of government funding, and managed to begin collaborative planning, but changes in public policy led to a quick demise. The Swedish case study developed local islands of collaborative learning, provided that champions managed to sustain their work. To conclude, we see two trajectories towards collaborative territorial planning shaped by different institutions: (1) regional level public core funding that can support planning processes top-down, or (2) establishment of voluntary local win-win solutions bottom-up. Both require committed stakeholders that are willing to employ a holistic perspective, and able to sustain resources in the long-term. However, despite a clearly stated goal towards multiple-use forest management, institutional legacies aiming at supporting maximum sustained yield wood production that have ruled the relationships between the state and the industry for so many years remain key barriers for multifunctional landscapes and regions.},

It reflects technological contexts such as collaboration, competition, or technological association. We represent interactive relations between assignees, inventors, patents and technology areas via knowledge graphs, which are merged into a technology ecology. We focus on the relation between assignee and technology area nodes which indicates the assignee adopted technology opportunities related to the area. Further, to find the clues on new links, we analyze common neighboring nodes and position of the two nodes with network metrics. Next, we use them in a machine learning-based link prediction model, thereby identifying new technology areas likely to be linked to a firm of interest as technology opportunity candidates. They are evaluated in terms of the firm's internal context and external context and ranked via the TOPSIS method. The case study covering a technology-based firm in the biotechnology domain showed the applicability and feasibility of our approach.},

While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the ability of a firm to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends is critical to its innovative capabilities. We label this capability a firm's absorptive capacity and suggest that it is largely a function of the firm's level of prior related knowledge. The discussion focuses first on the cognitive basis for an individual's absorptive capacity including, in particular, prior related knowledge and diversity of background. We then characterize the factors that influence absorptive capacity at the organizational level, how an organization's absorptive capacity differs from that of its individual members, and the role of diversity of expertise within an organization. We argue that the development of absorptive capacity, and, in turn, innovative performance are history- or path-dependent and argue how lack of investment in an area of expertise early on may foreclose the future development of a technical capability in that area. We formulate a model of firm investment in research and development (R\&D), in which R\&D contributes to a firm's absorptive capacity, and test predictions relating a firm's investment in R\&D to the knowledge underlying technical change within an industry. Discussion focuses on the implications of absorptive capacity for the analysis of other related innovative activities, including basic research, the adoption and diffusion of innovations, and decisions to participate in cooperative R\&D ventures.},

This paper offers specific tools and recommendations to overcome these challenges and facilitate an efficient collaboration. Specifically, a method for building a common project vocabulary and strategies for face-to-face group discussions are presented and tested. Recommendations regarding the usage and effectiveness of these strategies are based on the experiences of the SMARTEES Horizon 2020 interdisciplinary research project. The toolkit includes reproduction code for analyzing a project’s vocabulary, and a framework for planning and implementing effective structured discussions at project meetings.},

  abstract = {More precise explanations are needed to better understand why public green spaces are diminishing in cities, leading to the loss of ecosystem services that humans receive from natural systems. This paper is devoted to the incremental change of green spaces—a fate that is largely undetectable by urban residents. The paper elucidates a set of drivers resulting in the subtle loss of urban green spaces and elaborates on the consequences of this for resilience planning of ecosystem services. Incremental changes of greenspace trigger baseline shifts, where each generation of humans tends to take the current condition of an ecosystem as the normal state, disregarding its previous states. Even well-intended political land-use decisions, such as current privatization schemes, can cumulatively result in undesirable societal outcomes, leading to a gradual loss of opportunities for nature experience. Alfred E. Kahn referred to such decision making as ‘the tyranny of small decisions.’ This is mirrored in urban planning as problems that are dealt with in an ad hoc manner with no officially formulated vision for long-term spatial planning. Urban common property systems could provide interim solutions for local governments to survive periods of fiscal shortfalls. Transfer of proprietor rights to civil society groups can enhance the resilience of ecosystem services in cities.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the search for innovative pathways towards sustainability has been brought to the forefront of international agenda settings. While international organisations and institutions, such as the United Nations and the European Union (EU), mobilised around the grand challenge of sustainability, on both a local and a global scale, eco-innovation as a key concept (or buzzword) started emerging and consolidating in policy documents and funding schemes. By focusing on the European context, this paper aims to explore how the discourse of eco-innovation has been framed by the EU research funding programmes Horizon 2020 since the introduction of the 2011 Eco-Innovation Action Plan. The review was conducted by using content analysis methods designed to disclose the framing of eco-innovation in the EU programmes. The article presents three main findings: the eco-innovation discourse in the EU programmes has mostly become constructed around the notion of eco-efficiency; eco-innovation is overwhelmingly framed as a dialectic between the state vs private actors whereas stakeholders in the third sector such as cooperatives, non-governmental organisations, social enterprises, and community-based initiatives are largely neglected; eco-innovation as a buzzword has been losing relevance through the years in favour of the new rising discourse of the ‘circular economy’. The article concludes by suggesting that the construction of a new discourse on circular economy may provide opportunities to embrace more eco-centric and inclusive approaches to economics, towards stronger sustainability and the more systematic inclusion of not-for-profit organisations.},

This paper uses the rise in mass violence between 1870 and 1940 as an historical experiment for determining the impact of ethnic and political violence on economic activity, namely patenting. I find that violent acts account for more than 1,100 missing patents compared to 726 actual patents among African American inventors over this period. Valuable patents decline in response to major riots and segregation laws. Absence of the rule of law covaries with declines in patent productivity for white and black inventors, but this decline is significant only for African American inventors. Patenting responds positively to declines in violence. These findings imply that ethnic and political conflict may affect the level, direction, and quality of invention and economic growth over time.},

The empirical analysis is based on a novel and original database (BioPat) containing patents in the field of biofuels selected using appropriate keywords and classified according to the technological content of the invention. Our results generally show that technological capabilities and environmental regulation spur innovative activities in the biofuels sector. Both demand-pull and technology-push factors are found to be important drivers of innovation in the biofuels sector. However, technology exploitation activities in first generation technologies are found to be mainly driven by quantity and price-based demand-pull policies. On the contrary, the pace of technology exploration efforts in advanced generation biofuels is shown to react positively to price-based demand-pull incentives but also to technology-push policy. The clear diversity in the impact of different public support instruments provides new insights which fuel discussion on the optimal policy mix debate and offers new elements for the design of future policy strategies.},

We mapped the identified indicators against two established frameworks, the social foundations of the safe and just operating space for humanity, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to assess alignment and opportunities for extension. We identified socioeconomic indicators of sustainability not fully aligned with existing social foundations and classified these into three new social foundations: Family and Relationships, Perception of Self, and Social Security. Many indicators, especially those related to measuring happiness, hopes and dreams, personal progress, ethnicity and cultural background, physical appearance, or intelligence, were also absent from the SDGs. The extended social foundations along with the proposed indicators are intended to make the concepts of the safe and just space for humanity and the SDGs more inclusive and comprehensive.},

A new bioeconomy strategy aimed at promoting a sustainable Europe was launched in October 2018. However, little work has been done to monitor, model and appraise the impacts and developmental trajectories of bioeconomy sectors. To gauge the current sustainability performance of individual European countries, the present study proposes a new indicator – the “socio-economic indicator for the bioeconomy” (SEIB) – to measure the socio-economic performance of bioeconomy sectors. Drawing on Eurostat data and the analytic hierarchy process, multi-criteria decision analysis is employed with the aim of providing a direct comparison between member states (MSs). However, bioeconomy involves a large number of sectors and, therefore, it is useful to propose two versions of this indicator in order also to single out the impact of most innovative sectors: the first version considers all bio-based sectors (“SEIB for overall sectors”) while the second version excludes all primary sectors (“SEIB for manufacturing and bio-energy sectors”). The results identify three groups of MSs (virtuous, in-between and laggard) with reference to the European average. Ireland occupies the first position in the ranking, and only three other MSs (Denmark, Portugal and Austria) qualify as “virtuous” countries in both rankings.},

The definitions and differentiations have been derived from studies of industry and trade with the aim of striking a balance between, on the one side, economic history research with only little, mostly implicit, theory and, on the other side, very explicit theory with empirical data being used mainly to test more or less sophisticated models. There will be no attempt to outline a “general theory” which could possibly be tested empirically, i.e. by econometrics, but instead we shall seek to provide a sort of tool-box with analytical instruments, including the development block concept, which have proved useful in historical analyses. In a second section examples are given of Swedish industrial developments which have been analyzed and interpreted with the aid of such a tool-box. In the final section it is demonstrated how the results may be helpful in perceiving possible effects of various economic policies.

Some of them are reflected in price and cost signals in markets which are noted by firms and may give rise to new techniques and new products. Some of them come about by firms creating new markets for their products via entrepreneurial activities in other industries. This, too, may include the creation of new techniques and new products. In both cases, incomplete development blocks generate both difficulties and opportunities for firms. This analytical approach can contribute to closing the gap between micro and macro analysis.},

  abstract = {Despite their evidently different assumptions and operationalization strategies, the concepts of Circular Economy, Green Economy and Bioeconomy are joined by the common ideal to reconcile economic, environmental and social goals. The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an ‘umbrella’ concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation.},

  abstract = {The bioeconomy is currently being globally promoted as a sustainability avenue involving several societal actors. While the bioeconomy is broadly about the substitution of fossil resources with bio-based ones, three main (competing or complementary) bioeconomy visions are emerging in scientific literature: resource, biotechnology, and agroecology. The implementation of one or more of these visions into strategies implies changes to land use and thus ecosystem services delivery, with notable trade-offs. This review aims to explore the interdisciplinary space at the interface of these two concepts. We reviewed scientific publications explicitly referring to bioeconomy and ecosystem services in their title, abstract, or keywords, with 45 documents identified as relevant. The literature appeared to be emerging and fragmented but eight themes were discernible (in order of decreasing occurrence frequency in the literature): a. technical and economic feasibility of biomass extraction and use; b. potential and challenges of the bioeconomy; c. frameworks and tools; d. sustainability of bio-based processes, products, and services; e. environmental sustainability of the bioeconomy; f. governance of the bioeconomy; g. biosecurity; h. bioremediation. Approximately half of the documents aligned to a resource vision of the bioeconomy, with emphasis on biomass production. Agroecology and biotechnology visions were less frequently found, but multiple visions generally tended to occur in each document. The discussion highlights gaps in the current research on the topic and argues for communication between the ecosystem services and bioeconomy communities to forward both research areas in the context of sustainability science.},

  abstract = {In line with the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN 2030 Agenda, the circular bioeconomy concept is gaining greater political momentum and research interest. A circular bioeconomy implies a more efficient resource management of bio-based renewable resources by integrating circular economy principles into the bioeconomy. These ideas have been well received at industry level since they are deemed to foster cost reductions, innovation and competitiveness. While recent scientific literature has dwelt on sustainability-related circular business models, empirical research on company-level implementation is only just emerging. Our study contributes to addressing this research lacuna by seeking answers to two questions: 1. How do small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) propose, create and deliver, and capture value through circular bioeconomy business models?; and 2. What are the business challenges and opportunities related to the operationalization of such business models? To this end, we employed content analysis on interview data gathered from managers in Finnish SME companies from the field of packaging, textiles, composite materials, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We outlined the main business model archetypes, and identified the key characteristics that enable value capture and delivery for various stakeholders. The contribution of this study is duly two-fold. From the perspective of a theoretical contribution, we expand and refine the conceptualization of sustainable circular bioeconomy and related business models. In addition, based on our findings, we provide insights and recommendations for researchers and policy-makers to advance the sustainability transition to a circular bioeconomy in the context of the forest-based industry, and for the management of SMEs to reflect on company viability and growth.},

The study is based on new non-linear econometrics tools. First, we reassessed the existence of a significant cooling period using outliers and structural break tests and a nonlinear Markov Switching with Levy process (MS Levy) methodology. We found evidence of the existence of such a period between 1560-1660 and 1675-1700. In addition, we showed that NAO teleconnection was probably one of the causes of this climate change. We then performed nonlinear econometrics and causality tests to reassess the links between climate shock and macroeconomic indicators. While the causal relationship between temperature and agricultural output (yields, production, price) is strongly robust, the association between climate and GDP identified by the MS Levy model does not reveal a clear causality link. Although the MS Levy approach is not relevant in this case, the causality tests indicate that social disturbance might also have been triggered by climate change, confirming the view of Parker (2013). These findings should inform current public policies, especially with regard to the strong capacity of climate to disrupt social and economic stability.},

Due to the deliberate design of Swedish forest policy, private forest owners’ voluntary forest and biodiversity protection efforts are required to help close the policy gap. Using survey data from Swedish family forest owners, this paper outlines how forest owner attitudes reveal challenges and opportunities for two general strategies to increasing forest and biodiversity protection. The first strategy is attempting to institute changes within status quo Swedish forest policy by relying on family forest owners to make such changes voluntarily. The second strategy is encouraging management changes by using policy reforms. Our qualitative results suggest that Swedish forest policy is close to the limit of what can be accomplished with volunteerism alone and likely requires policy reforms to close its forest and biodiversity protection gap on family-owned forests.},

Instead, the functioning of nodes in one system often promotes or suppresses the functioning of nodes in another. Structural interdependence—that is, when the functionality of the nodes is determined exclusively by connectivity between layers—can be characterized via percolation processes on interdependent networks. However, modelling more general interactions between dynamical systems has remained an open problem. Here, we present a dynamic dependency framework that can capture interdependent and competitive interactions between dynamic systems, which we use to study synchronization and spreading processes in multilayer networks with interacting layers. By developing a mean-field theory, which we verify by simulations, we find coupled collective phenomena, including multistability, regions of coexistence, and macroscopic chaos. In interdependent dynamics, in particular, we observe hysteretic behaviours with abrupt (hybrid and explosive) transitions, that exhibit universal features that match those emerging from interdependent percolation. This dynamic dependency framework provides a powerful tool with which to improve our understanding of many of the interacting complex systems surrounding us.},

  abstract = {We study a model of innovation with a large number of firms that create new technologies by combining several discrete ideas. These ideas are created via private investment and spread between firms. Firms face a choice between secrecy, which protects existing intellectual property, and openness, which facilitates learning from others. Their decisions determine interaction rates between firms, and these interaction rates enter our model as link probabilities in a learning network. Higher interaction rates impose both positive and negative externalities, as there is more learning but also more competition. We show that the equilibrium learning network is at a critical threshold between sparse and dense networks. At equilibrium, the positive externality from interaction dominates: the innovation rate and welfare would be dramatically higher if the network were denser. So there are large returns to increasing interaction rates above the critical threshold. Nevertheless, several natural types of interventions fail to move the equilibrium away from criticality. One effective policy solution is to introduce informational intermediaries, such as public innovators who do not have incentives to be secretive. These intermediaries can facilitate a high-innovation equilibrium by transmitting ideas from one private firm to another.},

Using the anchor point of system leverage points and system characteristics (parameters, feedbacks, design and intent), we employ a diversity of examples to illustrate their relevance to multiple biodiversity related problems. We conclude by illustrating the opportunities for systems thinking to bridge epistemic divides with multiple biodiversity actors working towards conservation outcomes.

Through qualitative content analysis of a broad scope of archival documents (2474 in total), we define a cast of roles and determine their timing of entry onto the stage of ecosystem emergence, and in turn describe the interaction of these roles that govern emergence. We find that the locus of ecosystem emergence shifts gradually from discovery, resource provision and commitment, to the formation of connections and trust, and finally to complementarity and value creation. These activities are facilitated by specific roles that gain significance at various points in time. We additionally witness shifts in interaction dynamics, from individual level interactions early on, to interactions across levels, and finally to interactions at the organisational level. We synthesize these findings to propose a framework of a processual understanding of how innovation ecosystems come into existence.},

Next, it introduces the sources, methods, and models employed by scholars in major HCS disciplines. It continues by describing the debates, themes, and findings of HCS scholarship in its major disciplines, and then outlines the potential of transdisciplinary, ‘consilient’ approaches to the field.

Drawing upon a new corpus of both academic and non-academic literature, this work offers a framework for analysis, as well as an evidence-based survey of the challenges, for a green structural change of the economy. We argue that the combination of the innovation systems' view with the more recent “transformation turn” in innovation studies may provide an appropriate perspective for understanding the transition to a CE. Ultimately, the paper aims to capitalise on these insights to contribute to the design of policy guidelines and organisational strategies.},

However, the environmental impact of increased harvesting might be considerable, e.g. on soil and water chemistry, biodiversity and long-term productivity, and in this study we investigate thresholds for sustainable harvesting volumes. The study is based on scientific reviews of the impact of harvesting of logging residues (slash and stumps) on forest production, biodiversity, acidification, eutrophication and toxic substances. We define sustainability by using environmental objectives decided by the Swedish parliament (which are based on the Aichi targets), and relate the harvesting impact to these objectives within different harvesting scenarios, by using expert judgment. We demonstrate that an increase in harvesting of logging residues by 2.5 times might be sustainable. However, we also identify a number of risks and the sustainability depends on a number of requirements that should be fulfilled, such as ash-recycling. It was found that factors related to biodiversity conservation (defined in the goals `Sustainable Forests' and `A Rich Diversity of Plant and Animal Life') were limiting factors both for slash- and stump harvesting, and that risk of acidification (defined in the goal `Natural Acidification Only') also limit slash harvesting. We also include harvesting of brushwood and energy wood from conservation cutting in the discussion, since these assortments might be important in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, the data collected using these technologies are often very personal—indeed, the value of the data is often directly related to how personal they are. At the same time, driven by the replication crisis, there is a sustained push to publish data to open repositories. These movements are in fundamental conflict. In this article, we propose a way to navigate this issue. We argue that there are significant advantages to be gained by ceding the ownership of data to the participants who generate the data. We then provide desiderata for a privacy-preserving platform. In particular, we suggest that researchers should use an interface to perform experiments and run analyses, rather than observing the stimuli themselves. We argue that this method not only improves privacy but will also encourage greater compliance with good research practices than is possible through open repositories.},

  abstract = {Bioeconomy strategies in high income societies focus at replacing finite, fossil resources by renewable, biological resources to reconcile macro-economic concerns with climate constraints. However, the current bioeconomy is associated with critical levels of environmental degradation. As a potential increase in biological resource use may further threaten the capacity of ecosystems to fulfil human needs, it remains unclear whether bioeconomy transitions in high income countries are sustainable. In order to fill a gap in bioeconomy sustainability assessments, we apply an ontological lens of coupled social-ecological systems to explore critical mechanisms in relation to bioeconomy activities in the global resource system. This contributes to a social-ecological systems (SES)-based understanding of sustainability from a high income country perspective: the capacity of humans to satisfy their needs with strategies that reduce current levels of pressures and impacts on ecosystems. Building on this notion of agency, we develop a framework prototype that captures the systemic relation between individual human needs and collective social outcomes on the one hand (micro-level) and social-ecological impacts in the global resource system on the other hand (macro-level). The BIO-SES framework emphasizes the role of responsible consumption (for physical health), responsible production (to reduce stressors on the environment), and the role of autonomy and self-organisation (to protect the reproduction capacity of social-ecological systems). In particular, the BIO-SES framework can support (1) individual and collective agency in high income country contexts to reduce global resource use and related ecosystem impacts with a bioeconomy strategy, (2) aligning social outcomes, monitoring efforts and governance structures with place-based efforts to achieve the SDGs, as well as (3), advancing the evidence base and social-ecological theory on responsible bioeconomy transitions in the limited biosphere.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {IntroductionToward the middle of the nineteenth century, as the new industrial capabilities brought about by the Industrial Revolution made themselves felt with increasing force throughout northwestern Europe and North America, consumer behaviors had constructed two distinct forms of household economy. Among a growing class of servant-keeping households, a broad array of goods, most owing little directly to the Industrial Revolution itself, brought increasing domestic comfort, fashion, and variety to the middling classes and above. Below these middling classes matters were very different. Here, where the truly industrious households were most numerous, the consumer behaviors that had been developing since well before the Industrial Revolution were viewed by elite observers with concern and even horror. With their multiple income earners, vestigial household production, and individuated consumer aspirations, working-class families appeared to be both dysfunctional and disintegrating. Whether one turns to Frederic Le Play in France, Frederich Engels in England, or Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl in Germany, the founders of family sociology offered the same basic diagnosis: A traditional “family economy” where all members worked together in support of a common enterprise was being undermined by industrial capitalism. As E. P. Thompson so evocatively put it, under industrial capitalism “[t]he family was roughly torn apart each morning by the factory bell,” and the resulting centrifugal forces led its members toward selfish behaviors that began with deplorable consumer preferences, the insubordination of children, the neglect of the home by wives and mothers, and ultimately the dissolution of family ties.},

We combine territorial innovation system concepts with a technological innovation systems (TIS) perspective. The investigation of photovoltaic (PV) technology in Germany indicates that the relevance of different scales and actor constellations shifts in the course of a ‘maturing’ innovation system. First, the convergence of regional and institutional subsystems forms a temporary window of opportunity for a robust TIS formation within a national framing. Second, consolidation according to basic patterns of the underlying national innovation system takes place. This is illustrated by the robust performance of German mechanical PV equipment suppliers within a globalized PV value chain. The empirical findings allow for drafting a theoretical framework that offers a generalized view on this shifting spatial context pattern of an emerging environmental technology.},

This influence can be direct, through determining the magnitude, turnover rate, and longevity of carbon stocks in soil and vegetation. It can also be indirect through influencing the value and therefore the protection that societies give to ecosystems and their carbon stocks. Biodiversity of forested ecosystems has important consequences for long-term carbon storage, and thus warrants incorporation into the design, implementation, and regulatory framework of mitigation initiatives.},

We found strong proof of infrequent large shocks resulting essentially from the major economic and political events formed by the two World Wars in the twentieth century. Our results question the autonomous process, i.e. the internal dynamic of the patent systems. Wars seem to push innovation and finally the economic growth process itself. We further investigated the role of innovation in economic growth through a causality analysis between patents and GDP per capita. Our major findings support the assumption that the accumulation of innovations was a driving force only for France, the United Kingdom and the United States during the post World War II period.},

Consequently, research on stakeholder perceptions of the bioeconomy has increased, investigating questions of, e.g., underlying normative assumptions, political legitimacy and participation, or consumer acceptance. In order to identify the current state of research and avenues for further research, we conduct a systematic literature review of stakeholders’ bioeconomy perceptions. To this aim, we developed a mixed-methods approach based on the inductive coding of research articles. The review finds an overall dominance of biotechnology and resource themes, and a strong focus on research, policy and industry stakeholders. A lack of ecological and societal concerns, against the background of few research works on actors from civil society, suggests a gap between the bioeconomy as a sustainability concept and the perceptions of stakeholders involved. Overall, stronger consideration of societal stakeholders is required both in research and policy.},

This paper assesses these strategies in the context of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our theoretical framework differentiates between four pathways of bioeconomic developments. The extent to which bioeconomic developments along these pathways lead to increased sustainability depends on the creation of effective governance mechanisms. We distinguish between enabling governance and constraining governance as the two fundamental political challenges in setting up an effective governance framework for a sustainable bioeconomy. Further, we lay out a taxonomy of political support measures (enabling governance) and regulatory tools (constraining governance) that states can use to confront these two political challenges. Guided by this theoretical framework, we conduct a qualitative content analysis of 41 national bioeconomy strategies to provide systematic answers to the question of how well designed the individual national bioeconomy strategies are to ensure the rise of a sustainable bioeconomy.},

  abstract = {Support for parties opposed to European Union (EU) integration has risen rapidly, and a wave of discontent has taken over the EU. This discontent is purportedly driven by the very factors behind the surge of populism: differences in age, wealth, education, or economic and demographic trajectories. This paper maps the geography of EU discontent across more than 63,000 electoral districts in the EU-28 and assesses which factors push anti-EU voting. The results show that the anti-EU vote is mainly a consequence of local economic and industrial decline in combination with lower employment and a less educated workforce. Many of the other suggested causes of discontent, by contrast, matter less than expected, or their impact varies depending on levels of opposition to European integration.},

The Global Safety Net maps how expanded nature conservation addresses both overarching threats. We identify 50\% of the terrestrial realm that, if conserved, would reverse further biodiversity loss, prevent CO2 emissions from land conversion, and enhance natural carbon removal. This framework shows that, beyond the 15.1\% land area currently protected, 35.3\% of land area is needed to conserve additional sites of particular importance for biodiversity and stabilize the climate. Fifty ecoregions and 20 countries contribute disproportionately to proposed targets. Indigenous lands overlap extensively with the Global Safety Net. Conserving the Global Safety Net could support public health by reducing the potential for zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 from emerging in the future.},

Our motivation is policy analysis with panel data, particularly through the use of “synthetic control” methods. These methods regress pre-intervention outcomes of the treated unit to outcomes from a pool of control units, and then use the fitted regression model to estimate causal effects postintervention. In this setting, we propose to screen out control units that have a weak dynamical relationship to the treated unit. In simulations, we show that this method can mitigate bias from “cherry-picking” of control units, which is usually an important concern. We illustrate on real-world applications, including the tobacco legislation example of Abadie et al. (2010), and Brexit.},

In particular, there appear to be “technological paradigms” (or research programmes) performing a similar role to “scientific paradigms” (or research programmes). The model tries to account for both continuous changes and discontinuities in technological innovation. Continuous changes are often related to progress along a technological trajectory defined by a technological paradigm, while discontinuities are associated with the emergence of a new paradigm. One-directional explanations of the innovative process, and in particular those assuming “the market” as the prime mover, are inadequate to explain the emergence of new technological paradigms. The origin of the latter stems from the interplay between scientific advances, economic factors, institutional variables, and unsolved difficulties on established technological paths. The model tries to establish a sufficiently general framework which accounts for all these factors and to define the process of selection of new technological paradigms among a greater set of notionally possible ones. The history of a technology is contextual to the history of the industrial structures associated with that technology. The emergence of a new paradigm is often related to new “schumpeterian” companies, while its establishment often shows also a process of oligopolistic stabilization.},

This failure reflects inadequate attention to identification problems. Identification analysis should therefore be at the centre of future work on the empirics of complexity.},

The predominant technocratic and decisionist responses to this question misleadingly assume that value-neutral scientific recommendations for public policy means, or even objectives, are possible. On the other end of the spectrum, the literature on democratic and pragmatic models of expertise in policy often does not satisfactorily explain what researchers can contribute to public discourses surrounding disputed, value-laden policy objectives and means. Building on John Dewey's philosophy, this article develops the “pragmatic-enlightened model” (PEM) of assessment making, which refines the existing pragmatic models. It is used to some extent by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. According to the PEM's policy assessment methodology, policy objectives and their means can only be evaluated in light of the practical consequences of the means. Learning about the secondary effects, side effects and synergies of the best means may require a revaluation of the policy objectives, for instance, regarding the use of bioenergy for climate mitigation. Following the PEM, assessments would—based on a thorough problem analysis—explore alternative policy pathways, including their diverse practical consequences, overlaps and trade-offs, in cooperation with stakeholders. Such an arduous interdisciplinary cartography of multiple objectives, multi-functional policy means and the broad range of their quantitative and qualitative practical consequences may face considerable practical challenges and uncertainty. Yet, it could make assessments more policy-relevant and less prescriptive, and could effectively support a learning process about the political solution space.},

Overall, many national ideological battles follow the global meta-discourses, but linkages to these are much weaker for forestry practices.},

The harvesting pressure on the forests is likely to increase in the future because wood is seen as an important resource in a bio-based economy. Thus, there is an urgent need to better describe the trade-offs between wood production and biodiversity, and to understand how these trade-offs can be alleviated by adapting forest management. Encompassing a broad range of biodiversity aspects, we studied how forest management can increase biodiversity indicators while maintaining or increasing current harvest levels. We found that there is considerable leeway for forestry to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously in Fennoscandian forest landscapes. We show that it is possible to both increase harvests and structural elements of importance for biodiversity compared to present levels in a forest landscape that is representative of conditions in boreal forests in northern Sweden. Achieving this requires a variation in management strategies at the landscape level, and an adaptation of management practices to explicitly consider and implement multiple objectives in the planning process.},

There is a significant potential of biomass residues in Sweden suitable for the extraction of various compounds, including upgrading by biocatalytic processes, in addition to current energy generation. Two examples presented are quercetin extracted from onion waste by pressurised hot water in conjunction with enzymatic hydrolysis, and betulin from birch bark extracted by liquid CO2 containing ethanol. Inherent in these two extraction processes and production routes is the ability to show good environmental performance from a life cycle perspective. Extraction of high-value compounds also provides possibilities for innovation in the current agricultural, food and forest industry potentially leading to socio-economical benefits.

  abstract = {Building the adaptive capacity of interlinked social and ecological systems is assumed to improve implementation of sustainable forest management (SFM) policies. One mechanism is collaborative learning by continuous evaluation, communication, and transdisciplinary knowledge production. The Model Forest (MF) concept, developed in Canada, is intended to encourage all dimensions of sustainable development through collaboration among stakeholders of forest resources in a geographical area. Because the MF approach encompasses both social and ecological systems, it can be seen as a process aimed at improving adaptive capacity to deal with uncertainty and change. We analyzed multi-stakeholder approaches used in four MF initiatives representing social-ecological systems with different governance legacies and economic histories in the northwest of the Russian Federation (Komi MF and Pskov MF) and in Sweden (Vilhelmina MF and the Foundation Safsen Forests in the Bergslagen region). To describe the motivations behind development of the initiative and the governance systems, we used qualitative open-ended interviews and analyzed reports and official documents. The initial driving forces for establishing new local governance arrangements were different in all four cases. All MFs were characterized by multilevel and multi-sector collaboration. However, the distribution of power among stakeholders ranged from clearly top down in the Russian Federation to largely bottom up in Sweden. All MF initiatives shared three main challenges: (a) to develop governance arrangements that include representative actors and stakeholders, (b) to combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to governance, and (c) to coordinate different sectors' modes of landscape governance. We conclude that, in principle, the MF concept is a promising approach to multi-stakeholder collaboration. However, to understand the local and regional dimensions of sustainability, and the level of adaptability of such multi-stakeholder collaboration initiatives, empirical studies of outcomes are needed. To assess the adaptive capacity, the states and trends of economic, ecological, social, and cultural dimensions in actual landscapes need to be linked to how the multistakeholder collaboration develops and performs over the long term.},

We first compare definitions of SY forestry in national legislation and policies. Then we study forest management planning in two large forest management units with respect to: delivered forest products and values, how the harvest level of timber is defined, where the harvest takes place, and what treatments are used to sustain desired forest products and values. In Sweden SY forestry is maximum yield based on high-input forest management, and in Russia it is forestry based on natural regeneration with minimum investments in silviculture. We conclude that how SY forestry contributes to SFM depends on the context. Finally, we discuss the consequences of SY forestry as performed in Sweden and Russia related to its ability to support diverse forest functions, as envisioned in sustainable forest management policy.},

We find that Earth is exactly at the crossover point; in the year 2020~(±~6), the anthropogenic mass, which has recently doubled roughly every 20~years, will surpass all global living biomass. On average, for each person on the globe, anthropogenic mass equal to more than his or her bodyweight is produced every week. This quantification of the human enterprise gives a mass-based quantitative and symbolic characterization of the human-induced epoch of the Anthropocene.},

In such a context, countries are increasingly interested in assessing their relative competitiveness in order to better shape policies and business strategies. Going from UN Comtrade data, this paper provides a rich competitive analysis of the wooden furniture industry for 25 nations selected across all income groups and from diverse geographical regions. Balassa's index of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) along with two other competitiveness measures (market share and trade competitiveness) enable to conclude that, most African countries have remained in a position of comparative disadvantage, with no significant improvement over the years. However, Asian countries of different income groups emerged more competitive and act as palpable examples of successful upgrading in this sector. European and American countries on their part, despite exhibiting strong competitive positions, are nonetheless experiencing downward trends. This paper further highlights that, successful upgrading in the wooden furniture value chain can only be made possible by the inevitable interplay of actions by major stakeholders like government and industry actors, as well as individual firms. The findings of this study provide practical and policy implications whose significance span beyond the wooden furniture value chain.},

On the basis of a review of approaches for studying land-use intensity, we propose a conceptual framework to quantify and analyse land-use intensity. This framework integrates three dimensions: (a) input intensity, (b) output intensity, and (c) the associated system-level impacts of land-based production (e.g. changes in carbon storage or biodiversity). The systematic development of indicators across these dimensions would provide opportunities for the systematic analyses of the trade-offs, synergies and opportunity costs of land-use intensification strategies.},

This paper focuses on Swedish biofuel imports, both direct and indirect imports, the latter which derive from the fact that part of the imported pulpwood and timber end up as fuel. The objective is to describe the biomass import flows, the actors involved and analyse the fundamental drivers for the trade flows.The rapid expansion of biomass energy, that has taken place in district heating since the early 1990s in Sweden, has been met partly by imports. The direct biofuel import was estimated to for 2000, which corresponded to 26\% of the biofuel supply in district heating. The total indirect biofuel import was estimated to of which is consumed in the district heating sector. Sawmill wood chips, decay-damaged stemwood and pellets are imported from Estonia and Latvia, whereas used wood and solid recovered fuels are imported from Germany and the Netherlands. Tall oil and pellets are imported from North America.Key factors related to the Swedish biofuel import are analysed, both from the view of Swedish demand and from the view of supply in the Baltic countries as well as supply from Germany or the Netherlands. National differences in energy policy are perhaps the most important driving force behind the seemingly strange trade flows. Structures in the different national energy systems are also discussed as well as the transformation process that has taken place in the forest sector in the Baltic countries.},

  abstract = {Background. Mission-driven innovation (MDI) policies are founded on governmental attempts to address fundamental but complex societal challenges. The rationale behind such attempts is typically to influence the directionality of innovation towards addressing the perceived challenge. This report focuses on a particular instance of MDI policy executed by Sweden’s innovation agency, Vinnova: the funding of five so-called “mission-driven environments” (MDEs) in 2019. The policy in question is called ‘Vision-Driven Health’ and was initiated in 2019 to support the establishment of inter-organizational and cross-disciplinary coalitions that work towards a common vision and a long-term systemic transformation within the Swedish health care and life science sector. Aim. The report aims to provide a framework for evaluating five MDEs funded by Vinnova. Vinnova asked us to consider, in particular, the role of eight “Work Principles” (WPs) they recommended the MDEs implement. This report is the result of the first (of two) possible steps in evaluating the five MDEs. The first step is about developing a framework for evaluating MDEs. We hereafter refer to it as a pre-study. A second step would involve actually evaluating the five MDEs based on the framework in this report. Methods. The report is based on selective reviews of relevant literature providing insights about best practices for setting up and governing MDE-like initiatives and possible approaches and challenges to evaluating such initiatives. We also collected empirical data about how the five Swedish MDEs operationalized the principles. We surveyed members of the participating MDEs, asking them what a meaningful evaluation could imply from their perspectives. Finally, we consulted a group of external experts on three occasions. Findings. At an overall level, the Vinnova-recommended WPs partly align with practices recommended in the relevant literatures. However, the WPs are formulated abstractly and implemented heterogeneously by the five MDEs. We argue that this heterogeneous implementation is necessary for the MDEs to progress towards their visions but complicates a uniform set of evaluation principles. The MDEs also prioritize the WPs differently, and we observed an additional set of informal WPs. The literature consists primarily of normative studies defining MDI and its relevance and studies that discuss sets of challenges tied to evaluating MDI policies and initiatives. Empirical studies and evaluations remain scarce. Suggestions. Drawing on insights from the literature, we outline a framework for formative and summative evaluation that could be used to evaluate the MDEs and the WPs with which they are set to work. We specifically argue for combining contribution and attribution approaches to evaluation, which could include the following steps: Formative Evaluation Steps (A) If and to what extent the MDE is justified due to a “failure” of the system, market, or current development direction; (B) If and how the MDE’s governance arrangements are purposeful, consistent, and coherent (processes and structures; i.e., ways of working and formalized routines, standards, decisions, and rules); (C) If and how there is a “match” between the MDE’s interventions and identified barriers (weaknesses, bottlenecks, impeding regulations, social norms, etc.). Formative and Summative Evaluation Step (D) If and how the targeted overarching sociotechnical system/field demonstrates improved performance, such as capabilities (system functions and interactions like knowledge sharing), transition processes, and outcomes. Summative Evaluation Steps (E) If and how the targeted overarching sociotechnical system/field exhibits structural changes, such as a change in the types of innovations, new forms of cross-sectorial collaborations, or new networks constellations in the system, because of the MDE; (F) If and to what extent there is measurable impact on the societal level in terms of mitigating the failure addressed and reaching the MDE’s “vision” or “mission.” For evaluating specific MDEs, we conclude that the formative Steps B and C (and after the MDEs have been in operation for some time, Steps D and E, which also are discussed in the report) are of utmost relevance. Step A is a policy-mix decision, and Step F is an evaluation of the overall policy). For Steps B through E, we detail how an evaluation could be done and the type of data needed and exemplify useful methods for each evaluation step. Continuous Evaluations For Step B (governance arrangements), we suggest that evaluations focus on: Are the WP formulated necessary and sufficient for MDEs? Are some WPs more important than others to achieve the expected process outcomes? How do MDEs develop routines and decision rules to operationalize the WPs, and what are the results of their progress? For Step C, we suggest that each MDE evaluate the “match” between the interventions and initiatives they initiate and the barriers to reaching the vision they identified. This involves assessing whether an MDE seems to contribute to eliminating or diminishing the power of bottlenecks in a sociotechnical system. Ideally, this should focus on the most crucial bottlenecks. This step is a necessary precursor to evaluating whether the MDE spurs the emergence of new, needed functions in the sociotechnical system (Steps D and E). This type of evaluation must be (a) conducted on an ongoing basis and (b) handled or coordinated by the MDEs because identifying barriers to their goals and launching initiatives to address such barriers are, in fact, their raisons d’être. Ex Post Evaluations Summative and attribution-oriented evaluation steps aim to assess outcomes and the degree to which an MDE reached its goals. This implies a “working backwards” approach, where observable changes are reviewed, followed by an analysis of whether they can be linked causally to an MDE intervention/activity. Here we suggest evaluating whether and how the targeted sociotechnical system(s) demonstrates improved performance (formative/summative evaluation Step D) and whether the system exhibits any structural changes that facilitate reaching the vision (summative evaluation Steps E and F). Ideally, such evaluations should be conducted ex post the current MDE initiatives because systematic change often takes years to accrue. As such, these types of evaluations instead should be conducted by the policy actor or external evaluators working on their behalf, not the MDEs. Considerations. The MDEs in focus are similar in having received funding (relatively small relative to other MDI initiatives globally) from Vinnova and being instructed to implement eight WP. However, the MDEs also were given agency in determining what challenges to focus on, how to design their vision, and how to implement the WP. We show that the MDEs exhibit great differences in these regards, which has logical consequences for designing an evaluation approach that is useful for all five. Thus, we caution against assessing the MDEs uniformly on all WPs or mere “vision attainment.” Instead, we argue that an evaluation of the MDEs also needs to assess the WPs; that is, it should evaluate the policy design of the overall MDE program. Finally, a prerequisite for addressing multiple and diverse stakeholders’ needs is to gain their trust. Stakeholders who are more engaged with and understand the evaluation’s wider purposes are less inclined to feel “threatened” and will impart more useful and meaningful information. Thus, we argue for actively involving the MDEs in the evaluation steps (especially Step C, which is a tool to actively help them prioritize, document, and evaluate the actions and initiatives they take) and, whenever needed, organize external expert panels to assist them in this work.},

  abstract = {The main object of this paper is to investigate the impact of environment-related networks (or eco-networks), which we interpret as a type of open eco-innovation, on employment. We exploit information from an original dataset which reveals collaboration among Italian enterprises that have signed business network agreements (BNAs), a policy instrument that was first introduced in 2009, and started in 2010, to strengthen the innovation and competitiveness of Italian firms. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that the intensity in the use of networks positively affects employment and that the marginal impact of increasing the intensity of BNAs in eco-networks on employment is larger than in other network. This is partly due to the fact that eco-networks rely more often on market strategies which are linked to product innovation. Finally, the sectoral heterogeneity of networks seems to be beneficial for employment creation, with a larger marginal effect for eco-networks than other networks. These results suggest that two important goals, environmental sustainability and employment creation, can be reconciled by means of flexible policy instruments that encourage open innovation and the sharing of knowledge and resources among firms.},

In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on these landowners to encapsulate a current lay of the land in terms of what we know about these landowners and move the dialogue on this topic forward. Eighty-one articles are identified in our search of empirical literature. For each of the landowner types, we discuss their demographics and the three primary themes that emerged related to land management: participation in land management decisions, attitudes regarding land use and ownership, and resource needs in working with these landowners. For agricultural non-operating landowners, we find limited participation in land management decisions, particularly among women, a variety of individual and social factors play a role in involvement, and while they have pro-conservation attitudes, implementation of conservation practices is more limited. Absentee forest landowners we find are more willing to use management plans, yet less willing to engage in active management and risk reduction. These landowners have a range of attitudes regarding land use, with studies highlighting recreation, conservation, and profit motivations. Our review concludes with identifying specific needs for more research and outreach on these landowners.},

On the basis of this understanding, it draws potential new strategies for an effective transition. To operationalize our theoretical approach, we employed the single case study method, drawing on an in-depth literature review and a SWOT analysis (i.e. analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) of the Italian forest sector, validated by expert interviews and a questionnaire survey. The results show that the most effective strategies for the transition are: improving environmental and forest planning tools by defining viable methods of circular management; promoting investment in forest infrastructure; supporting entrepreneurship programs for forest professionals; and enhancing innovative forest-based value chains. The diversity of the identified policy strategies provides evidence of the necessity for policy makers to go beyond a simple “best option” approach, given the system complexity of the forest sector.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are dynamic systems with complex responses to environmental variation. In response to pervasive stressors of changing climate and disturbance regimes, many ecosystems are realigning rapidly across spatial scales, in many cases moving outside of their observed historical range of variation into alternative ecological states. In some cases, these new states are transitory and represent successional stages that may ultimately revert to the pre-disturbance condition; in other cases, alternative states are persistent and potentially self-reinforcing, especially under conditions of altered climate, disturbance regimes, and influences of non-native species. These reorganized states may appear novel, but reorganization is a characteristic ecosystem response to environmental variation that has been expressed and documented throughout the paleoecological record. Resilience, the ability of an ecosystem to recover or adapt following disturbance, is an emergent property that results from the expression of multiple mechanisms operating across levels of organism, population, and community. We outline a unifying framework of ecological resilience based on ecological mechanisms that lead to outcomes of persistence, recovery, and reorganization. Persistence is the ability of individuals to tolerate exposure to environmental stress, disturbance, or competitive interactions. As a direct expression of life history evolution and adaptation to environmental variation and stress, persistence is manifested most directly in survivorship and continued growth and reproduction of established individuals. When persistence has been overcome (e.g., following mortality from stress, disturbance, or both), populations must recover by reproduction. Recovery requires the establishment of new individuals from seed or other propagules following dispersal from the parent plant. When recovery fails to re-establish the pre-disturbance community, the ecosystem will assemble into a new state. Reorganization occurs along a gradient of magnitude, from changes in the relative dominance of species present in a community, to individual species replacements within an essentially intact community, to complete species turnover and shift to dominance by plants of different functional types, e.g. transition from forest to shrub or grass dominance. When this latter outcome is persistent and involves reinforcing mechanisms, the resulting state represents a vegetation type conversion (VTC), which in this framework represents an end member of reorganization processes. We explore reorganization in greater detail as this phase is increasingly observed but the least understood of the resilience responses. This resilience framework provides a direct and actionable basis for ecosystem management in a rapidly changing world, by targeting specific components of ecological response and managing for sustainable change.},

  abstract = {Biogas production through anaerobic digestion is an integral part of the transition toward a biobased and circular economy and its expansion is foreseen in many parts of the world as well as in Europe. In Sweden, a governmental inquiry suggested biogas production to be increased from about 2~TWh today to 7~TWh by 2030. This rapid expansion would require installation of several new biogas plants across the country. However, the location of biogas plants can greatly affect its business performance and there are several geographic and socio-political factors that would limit the choice of location. Through dialogue with existing biogas producing companies and a few other related actors, we identified 12 factors that are commonly considered in the site-selection of biogas plants in Sweden or are considered to be important in the years to come. These factors are grouped into those related to supply and demand (feedstock supply, biogas demand, digestate demand, and carbon dioxide demand), infrastructure and synergies (available infrastructure, adjacent existing industries), land-use and zoning (nearby housing, zoning, and historic preservation sites), and socio-political context (political strategies and goals, organizational capability, and local social acceptance). We discuss how these factors can be used under rapidly transforming conditions in Sweden through different site-selection logics and highlight the importance of spatially explicit analysis for individual or coordinated decision making in future. Our method of enquiry and analysis, and to a certain degree the factors, can be also relevant for other countries, particularly in Europe. This study paves the way for more in-depth investigation of the question of site-selection of biogas plants in Sweden; both in the direction of detailed analysis at the local level, or screening analysis on the regional or national level for improved coordinated actions.},

Here we used different high-resolution satellite datasets to show a doubling of gross tropical forest carbon loss worldwide from 0.97\,±\,0.16\,PgC\,yr−1 in 2001–2005 to 1.99\,±\,0.13\,PgC\,yr−1 in 2015–2019. This increase in carbon loss from forest conversion is higher than in bookkeeping models forced by land-use statistical data, which show no trend or a slight decline in land-use emissions in the early twenty-first century. Most (82\%) of the forest carbon loss is at some stages associated with large-scale commodity or small-scale agriculture activities, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. We find that \textasciitilde 70\% of former forest lands converted to agriculture in 2001–2019 remained so in 2020, confirming a dominant role of agriculture in long-term pan-tropical carbon reductions on formerly forested landscapes. The acceleration and high rate of forest carbon loss in the twenty-first century suggest that existing strategies to reduce forest loss are not successful; and this failure underscores the importance of monitoring deforestation trends following the new pledges made in Glasgow.},

However, the research that bridges national innovation systems and sustainability is scant. This study seeks to contribute to bridging this gap by exploring the relationships between national innovation systems and environmental sustainability at the country level. The multiple regression analysis shows that developed national innovation systems can enhance environmental sustainability at the country level, which should be accompanied by a transition towards sustainable consumption behavior and business practices. This study suggests that developing national innovation systems to foster environmental sustainability should encompass systemic changes that nurture and mold the multiple national innovation systems' factors and enable (environmentally) sustainable outputs. Implications of the findings for policy, theory, and management are discussed before concluding with the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.},

The empirical analysis is built using multivariate probit models and considering a sample of Chilean firms in the period 2009-2016. Results show a displacement of open innovation drivers when a developing country is analyzed; Collaboration with Partners, Alliances and Networks, along with the Non R\&D Embedded are predominant technological push strategies in this analysis. Furthermore, Market factors would have a driving effect on eco-innovations, while the Public Support is weakly significant.},

Yet despite advances in our understanding of evolution, what drives innovation remains elusive. On the one hand, organizations invest heavily in systematic strategies to accelerate innovation. On the other, historical analysis and individual experience suggest that serendipity plays a significant role. To unify these perspectives, we analysed the mathematics of innovation as a search for designs across a universe of component building blocks. We tested our insights using data from language, gastronomy and technology. By measuring the number of makeable designs as we acquire components, we observed that the relative usefulness of different components can cross over time. When these crossovers are unanticipated, they appear to be the result of serendipity. But when we can predict crossovers in advance, they offer opportunities to strategically increase the growth of the product space.},

  abstract = {As 2021 saw the launch of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, it highlighted the need to prepare for success over the decade and to understand what public economic and financial incentives exist to support sustainable forest and landscape restoration. To date, Initiative 20~×~20, a coalition of 18 Latin American countries, has committed to place 50 million hectares under restoration and conservation by 2030. Understanding the public policies in these countries that turn those commitments into action, however, is very labor-intensive, requiring decision makers to read and analyze thousands of pages of documents that span multiple sectors, ministries, and scales that lie outside of their areas of expertise. To address this, we developed a semi-automated policy analysis tool that uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to mine policy documents, assist the labeling process carried out by policy experts, automatically identify policies that contain incentives and classify them by incentive instrument from the following categories: direct payments, fines, credit, tax deduction, technical assistance and supplies. Our best model achieves an F1 score of 93–94\% in both identifying an incentive and its policy instrument, as well as an accuracy of above 90\% for 5 out of 6 policy instruments, reducing multiple weeks of policy analysis work to a matter of minutes. In particular, the model properly identified the relative frequency of credits, direct payments, and fines that exist as the primary policy instruments in these countries. We also found that tax deductions, supplies, and technical assistance are much less used among most of the countries and that, oftentimes, the policy documents describe economic incentives for restoration in vague and intangible terms. In addition, our model is designed to constantly improve its performance with more data and feedback from policy experts. Furthermore, while our experiments were run on Spanish policy documents, we designed our framework to be widely scalable to policies from different countries and multiple languages, limited only by the number of languages supported by current multilingual NLP models. Using a standardized approach to generate incentives data could provide an evidence-based and transparent system to find complementarity between policies and help remove barriers for implementers and policymakers and enable a more informed decision-making process.},

Storylines of Swedish forests in the bioeconomy unite wider European discourses on the bioeconomy and climate change with historical Swedish forest policy discourses, revitalizing a discourse coalition comprising the state and the industry.

  abstract = {The use of solid wood biofuels for energy production in heating plants has increased drastically during the last decades. Great interest has been shown in replacing unsustainable road transport of wood fuel with more sustainable intermodal transport. This paper maps the common business models for biofuel transport in Sweden and suggests how these models may be developed to accommodate intermodal transport. A view of the biofuel supply chain as five overlapping networks (industry, material, operations, transport, and infrastructure) connected by four transaction markets (sourcing, operations, transport, and traffic) have been used. Four typical business models have been found: Regional/National Biofuel Company, Local Biofuel Company, Heating Plant Own Account, and Wood Processing Industry. Cooperation and vertical integration among the actors are important to reach the large transport volumes required for intermodal transport. Key issues to increase the intermodal potential are: increased vertical integration and cooperation, sharing of transport resources and infrastructure, joint purchases, outsourcing to expert actors, building trust and open communication, and not underestimating the complexity of intermodal transport. The results have implications for any actor interested in developing intermodal transport or policy measures. The contribution includes the new approach of developing business models by using the five-layer network-market model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one.

Through a quantitative analysis of the 14th–18th centuries series of real wages and population shocks in fourteen European cities, I find that in four north-western cities (Amsterdam, Antwerp, London, and Oxford) the urban real wages were detached from population before the Industrial Revolution, while, in the central and southern Europe wages had a moderate or negative response to population changes. In addition, I show that this different response dates back to the 16th century. I claim, that these two results support three possibly non alternative interpretations of the “little divergence”, either based on changes of fertility regimes, rural and urban labor organizations, or on the onset, in early modern north-western Europe, of non strictly Malthusian growth mechanisms.},

Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

In doing so, it provides new insights that can aid in understanding the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain that promotes sustainable benefits for companies and their stakeholders, stimulating green innovation as a key to making business more circular. Method ology: Using a structured questionnaire, this study gathers data from a cross-sectional sample of 425 supply chain partners of Portugal's biggest energy supplier. Structural equation modelling is used to test the proposed hypotheses, and the impact of customer pressure on the suggested relationships is assessed through a multi-group analysis. Findings The findings suggest that SCL, SCF and GSCI positively impact GRI. Additionally, this study reveals that GNPD has a positive impact on PRF. Supply chain customer pressure appears to moderate some of the proposed relationships. Implications/originality This article provides some empirical evidence of the influence of SCL, SCF and GSCI on organizational value creation, contributing to a better understanding of the impacts of green innovation approaches on business sustainability. The overall results may support the importance of collaborative behavior in the supply chain for creating value for business, responding at the same time to the environmental sustainability challenges that humanity is facing, considering the role of customer pressure in moderating these relationships. Results show that, by being greener, a company may be more competitive, thus highlighting the importance of the collaboration between responsible and committed leaders and proactive followers for creating a better future for all. Limitations The research considered the suppliers of only one company. The relationships between variables need to be explored in other practical case studies and longitudinal research to improve the potential for extrapolating generalizations and establishing clear causalities.},

  abstract = {Effectively designed data visualizations allow viewers to use their powerful visual systems to understand patterns in data across science, education, health, and public policy. But ineffectively designed visualizations can cause confusion, misunderstanding, or even distrust—especially among viewers with low graphical literacy. We review researchbacked guidelines for creating effective and intuitive visualizations oriented toward communicating data to students, coworkers, and the general public. We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display, whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow. Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions. Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication, provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience.},

Existing conceptualisations differ substantially in underlying assumptions and analytical scope. Yet, a systematic identification of differences between analytical frameworks is missing. To fill this gap, we explore the explanatory power of a deliberative, a regulatory and a transition pathways perspective on regime destabilisation governance. Each represented by a key analytical framework, these perspectives are comparatively applied to German pesticide policy in the context of European multilevel governance. We find that each documents different aspects of governance efforts to destabilise the incumbent pesticide regime. Through a content analysis of policy documents, we reveal how policy, especially on the European level, is increasingly, but incompletely oriented away from the incumbent pesticide regime, expressed in discursive shifts, changes in policy instruments and evolving political goal setting, respectively. Thus, we identify avenues for developing more robust frameworks of regime destabilisation governance.},

  abstract = {Dominant approaches to research quality rest on the assumption that academic peers are the only relevant stakeholders in its assessment. In contrast, impact assessment frameworks recognize a large and heterogeneous set of actors as stakeholders. In transdisciplinary research non-academic stakeholders are actively involved in all phases of the research process and actor-network theorists recognize a broad and heterogeneous set of actors as stakeholders in all types of research as they are assigned roles in the socio-material networks, also termed ‘problematizations’, that researchers reconfigure. Actor-network theorists consider research as a performative act that changes the reality of the stakeholders it, knowingly or unknowingly, involves. Established approaches to, and notions of, research quality do not recognize the heterogeneity of relevant stakeholders nor allow for reflection on the performative effects of research. To enrich the assessment of research quality this article explores the problematization as a potential new object of evaluation. Problematizations are proposals for how the future might look. Hence, their acceptance does not only concern fellow academics but also all other human and other-than-human actors that figure in them. To enrich evaluative approaches, this article argues for the inclusion of stakeholder involvement and stakeholder representation as dimensions of research quality. It considers a number of challenges to doing so including the identification of stakeholders, developing quality criteria for stakeholder involvement and stakeholder representation, and the possibility of participatory research evaluation. It can alternatively be summarized as raising the question: for whose benefit do we conduct evaluations of research quality?},

In this paper, we study the role of GVCs in the venture capital market and their relationship with Private Venture Capitalists (PVC). Using European data, we find that GVCs invest consistently with their policy mandates, favoring specific industries, geographical areas, and firms with high innovation potential, but have lower average performances. These findings indicate that GVCs can identify innovative companies and prioritize positive externalities over profit maximization. We build an asset pricing model with heterogeneous preferences to study the role of GVCs in catalyzing PVC investments. We find that PVCs invest less in startups previously funded by GVCs, in line with empirical evidence. At aggregate level, GVC investments can crowd-in private ones if they focus on startups in VC hubs.},

  abstract = {Forest disturbances in Europe are very likely to increase in frequency and intensity. Assessing their economic consequences is required to identify feasible adaptation strategies. Such economic calculations depend on estimates for the reduction in revenues after disturbance events. These losses can be caused by both a lower wood quality as well as an oversupply on the wood markets. Despite its importance, data-driven approaches to quantify the consequences of disturbances on wood revenues in Central Europe are rare. We applied econometric time series analysis with Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models to harvest and sales data from Hesse, Germany. Additionally, we derived estimates for reductions in wood revenues for integration in bioeconomic simulation models. Our analyses indicate that the observed losses in wood revenues for spruce after disturbances are mainly due to an oversupply on the wood markets, rather than a loss in wood quality. In addition, the results suggest that calamities of transregional extent or multiple disturbances in subsequent years are likely to reduce wood revenues beyond the assumptions often used in bioeconomic simulation models. Although our results for beech were more ambiguous, they indicate that losses in revenues for beech after disturbances in the past were mainly due to a reduced wood quality. Our study highlights the importance of taking a differentiated view on the consequences of disturbances on wood revenues, considering their spatial extent and species-specific mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the question why socio-technical transitions follow similar trajectories in various parts of the world, even though the relevant material preconditions and institutional contexts vary greatly between different regions and countries. It takes a critical stance on the implicit methodological nationalism in transition studies’ socio-technical regime concept and proposes an alternative ‘global’ regime perspective that embraces the increasingly multi-scalar actor networks and institutional rationalities, which influence transition dynamics beyond national or regional borders. By drawing on globalization theories from sociology and human geography, we show that socio-technical systems often develop institutional rationalities that are diffused via international networks and thus become influential in various places around the world. In so doing, we shed light on the multi-scalar interrelatedness of institutional structures and actors in socio-technical systems and elaborate on the implications for the conceptualization of transition dynamics. The paper illustrates this with the case study of an unsuccessful transition in the Chinese wastewater sector. Recent studies indicate that key decisions on wastewater infrastructure expansion were not only influenced by path-dependencies stemming from China’s national context, but equally (or even more critically) by the dominant rationality of the water sector’s global socio-technical regime. We conclude by discussing the contours of a new research agenda around the notion of global socio-technical regimes.},

The objectives of this paper are to communicate innovation theory to the different actors in the system under a common perspective and to reveal the complexity of innovation systems. The new concept has at its centre the firm, which is the generator and promoter of innovations in the market, the industrial sector and the nation. The model's main focus is the Knowledge Creation from public or industrial research; the New Product Design and Development process, and the Product Success in the market. This process is affected by other internal factors of the firm as well as by the National Innovation Environment.

Despite an increased scholarly and policy interest in the dynamics of these perceived "tipping points," institutional and governance scholars have yet to make progress on how to analyze in which ways state and non-state actors attempt to anticipate, respond, and prevent the transgression of "tipping points" at large scales. In this article, we use three cases of global network responses to what we denote as global change-induced "tipping points"-ocean acidification, fisheries collapse, and infectious disease outbreaks. Based on the commonalities in several research streams, we develop four working propositions: information processing and early warning, multilevel and multinetwork responses, diversity in response capacity, and the balance between efficiency and legitimacy. We conclude by proposing a simple framework for the analysis of the interplay between perceived global change-induced "tipping points," global networks, and international institutions.},

This study identifies the 30 firm performance indicators most cited by researchers and classifies them into four different green innovation types, i.e. product, process, organizational and marketing.

This information is necessary to obtain an accurate measurement of eco-innovation level and it is useful to companies and stakeholders for performance evaluation. Moreover, understanding which performance indicators are more suitable for measuring the level of environmental innovation affords governments the possibility to draft policies that encourage companies to be more sustainable and firms to implement green practices in a more efficient way.},

The renormalization group provides a powerful framework to study these symmetries, leading to a better understanding of the universal properties of phase transitions. However, the small-world property of complex networks complicates application of the renormalization group by introducing correlations between coexisting scales. Here, we provide a framework for the investigation of complex networks at different resolutions. The approach is based on geometric representations, which have been shown to sustain network navigability and to reveal the mechanisms that govern network structure and evolution. We define a geometric renormalization group for networks by embedding them into an underlying hidden metric space. We find that real scale-free networks show geometric scaling under this renormalization group transformation. We unfold the networks in a self-similar multilayer shell that distinguishes the coexisting scales and their interactions. This in turn offers a basis for exploring critical phenomena and universality in complex networks. It also affords us immediate practical applications, including high-fidelity smaller-scale replicas of large networks and a multiscale navigation protocol in hyperbolic space, which betters those on single layers.},

  abstract = {This article sets out an alternative approach to the assessment and regulation of technology and innovation, situated in and aiming at degrowth and building on an idea first put forward in the late 1970s by Langdon Winner called “methodological Luddism”. Methodological Luddism does not have the original meaning of destroying machines, nor does it reflect a prejudiced attitude or a negative view of technology. As outlined in this article, it sets out to overcome the presumption that technology is valueneutral and to lower the inflated expectations with which it is generally associated. Technology and forms of life are mutually interdependent, and this implies examining the constructive possibilities for withdrawing from some technologies and adopting others, while ensuring that their role is limited to means designed to achieve certain predefined ends. The article draws on the work of Hans Jonas and Albert Borgmann, authors yet to be acknowledged by the degrowth literature. Jonas’ principle of responsibility is a response to the excessive prowess of modern technologies, while Borgmann suggests a reform of technology through focal things and practices. Building on these concepts, methodological Luddism advocates reassessing and reorienting technologies so that informed decisions may be taken as to how they should be designed and developed as means to socially equitable and ecologically sustainable ends. In this way the technological sphere may become an important ally in the transformative change in society which is required to fulfil the axiological parameters of degrowth.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development indicators (SDIs) may have good potential to bring environmental concerns to the policy agenda. However, different understandings of sustainability, definitions of SDIs and measurement procedures may give completely different assessments of whether society moves towards a sustainable development path or not. Compilation of statistical indicators for environmental change and sustainability comprises not only a selection of facts in some technical sense, as the choices involved are conditioned by societal interests and implicit values embedded in the data-generating processes. This implies that statistical offices cannot ignore the role that values play in the generation of accurate data sets. To give an assessment of sustainability, we need not only to address historical trends but also to evaluate policy choices made today and how they may influence future development. SDI sets should be evaluated according to how they contribute to deliberation on sustainability in learning processes involving participants beyond the science–policy interface.

  abstract = {The circular economy, from an urban organic waste perspective, is seen as an approach to deal with increasing waste streams, while contributing to meeting the increasing demand for water, energy, food and other resources in urban areas. However, there is need for a systematic assessment of the broader environmental and social benefits and trade-offs of resource recovery from organic waste streams. This paper presents a framework for assessing the societal impacts of increased circularity in terms of resource recovery from organic waste streams at city scale, building on the design of alternative scenarios for future technology systems. The framework was developed based on a literature review of current frameworks in the area, adapting and combining some of their aspects and adding required features to allow for a broad sustainability assessment. It was also informed by stakeholder interviews. The framework was applied to the case of Naivasha, Kenya to illustrate its applicability and usefulness. The outcome of the application in the Naivasha case indicate potential sustainability improvements from increased circularity, where resource recovery could lead to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, more efficient natural resource usage and job creation. It indicated also some risks of negative impacts on the health of workers in resource recovery facilities, and, in this specific case, negative impact on smallholder farmers. The framework proved applicable and useful in the case study, and hence could provide input at early stages of planning even with low availability of data. Thereby it could provide policy-relevant insights towards circular economy implementation approaches that harness the benefits while mitigating any identified potential negative impacts. In 2015, the ‘Fundão’ dam's failure in Brazil released 44 million m3 of tailings that traveled 670 km in the ‘Doce’ river watershed crossing 40 municipalities and two states until reaching the Atlantic Ocean. Since then, a public civil action (PCA) is responsible for litigation processes, and recently established a value of US\$ 43.8 billion to repair losses and damages, a value that brings doubts about its accuracy in expressing the loses and damages of the disaster. This claims for alternative methods for its monetary quantification than the current tradicional economic ones. Among others biophysical approaches, the emergy accounting appears as a powerful tool due to its donor side perspective that objectively quantifies value and recognizes energy quality. This study aims to use emergy accounting as method to firstly identify and then quantify the impacts of ‘Fundão’ dam's failure, considering exclusively the negative direct and immediate impacts. Three categories are considered to quantify loses and damages: (I) suppressed stocks in the mud passage and deposition areas (MPDA), (II) social disruption, and (III) changes in landscape. For all the three scenarios of turnover times (Tt), results show that about 98\% of total emergy in the suppressed stocks are related to (II) and (III), while only 2\% in average is related to (I). This discrepancy highlights the importance of accounting for (II) and (III) since they are often disregarded or not directly considered by traditional economic approaches. From a macroeconomic perspective, the highest total emergy-based dollars (emdollar, EmUS\$) found for scenario \#3 reached EmUS\$ 149.18 billion, a value 3.4 times higher than the US\$ 43.8 billion established by PCA. This higher value is equivalent to the annual emergy demanded by the Ecuador economy with 18 million inhabitants. Rather than providing an accurate monetary value for the ‘Fundão’ disaster repair, this study contributes for the advancement of discussions about using biophysical methods such as emergy accounting that allows tracking all numbers for objective verification as alternative to the traditional economic approaches in quantifying losses and damages of high proportion disasters. In typical Mediterranean settings farming systems are key components and have an impact on the community structure and the environment in which they take place hence it is important to develop tools for Sustainability Assessment (SA). To enable positive change it is necessary to effectively allocate resources. Thus, it is important to understand how farmers’ decision-making impacts their farm’s sustainability performance and their awareness and use of Decision Support Tools (DST) for sustainable management. Twenty representative farms were selected from the National Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) for the regional unit of Argolida (Peloponnese, Greece). To investigate sustainability on these farms an indicator-based method, RISE 3.0, was employed to evaluate the current situation and semi-structured phone interviews were used to identify and analyse patterns and attitudes within the data regarding decision-making, sustainability performance and DST with the help of thematic analysis. The results demonstrate that the decision-making process was poorly informed and not always evidence-based while the concept of sustainability was not well understood by most of the farmers. The sustainability assessment illustrated the specific strengths and weaknesses of farm businesses in the area whereas the correlation of the RISE assessment with perceptions of farmers on decision-making and sustainability performance identified the challenges of moving towards more sustainable systems in typical Mediterranean environments. This study presents an ecological accounting for the Chinese society using improved extended exergy accounting method. Based on the input–output table of China, we capture the economic linkages of societal labor and capital fluxes, and improve the equivalent exergy metrics of labor and capital to be consistent with the Chinese situation. Material and externalities-equivalent exergy structures are examined by the quantitative estimation and indicator assessment. Results show that the total resource consumption of the Chinese society amounted to 151.6 EJ in 2012, while the total equivalent exergetic values of labor, capital and environmental remediation cost were estimated at 67.0 EJ, 69.1 EJ and 411.5 EJ, respectively. The national total capital and labor input was close to its resource consumption, but only equal to one third of the environmental remediation cost, highlighting the contribution of ecosystem products and services. An overall system diagram covering major extended-exergy inflows and outflows within the society was designed to display the complex metabolism process and network relationship of resource use, economic production and environmental externalities in an integrative way. Exergy and extended exergy analyses of the Chinese society for a benchmark year contributes to understanding the operation of a socio-economic system from a biophysical perspective and establishing effective regulatory strategies of production and consumption activities to accelerate a shift towards sustainability. The transition to a circular economy is often presented as a straightforward, neutral and apolitical process, characterised by an implicit techno-optimistic and eco-modernist stance. However, in their recent paper on ‘circular futures’, Bauwens et al. (2020) illustrate that the circular economy is best understood as an umbrella term that might come to define very contrasting visions of sustainable development. Despite this, there continues to be a lack of discussion about the basic assumptions regarding social and economic structures on which the circular economy should be based, with research predominantly focusing on technical and practical questions. Therefore, in this conceptual paper, we assess the a priori compatibility of different plausible configurations of the circular economy with the principal theories of value found in mainstream and heterodox economics. We argue that these futures are themselves value articulating institutions that implicitly adhere to a theory of value even if this is not recognised. Moreover, given that theories of value go to the heart of how economies and societies function and reproduce themselves, we argue that circular economy research should recognise the importance of value and acknowledge how value theory might enable or contradict the visions of sustainable development articulated. Sustainable production and consumption of food systems cannot be achieved without considering the entirety of the supply chain and the actors involved at each stage along the way. This requires more in-depth analyses of social dimensions often neglected in favor of the environmental and economic ones. Yet, inattention to the social dimension of sustainability in food supply chains has yielded a lack of agreement regarding what to consider and how to measure it. This review identifies the current state of art of how social sustainability aspects are measured through various tools and indicators, following the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) protocol. The selection criteria resulted in 101 papers and gray literature documents published from 2000 to 2021. Thirty-four social sustainability tools are analyzed based on five food supply chain stages, namely production, processing, wholesale, retail, and consumer and four stakeholders as adapted from the most recent Social Life Cycle Assessment guidelines, namely farmers, workers, consumers, and society. Production and processing-related assessment tools are mostly publicly funded, while wholesale, retail, and consumer tools are often privately funded. Moreover, the availability of assessment tools decreases along the supply chain. Production has the highest number of tools (17) and quantitative indicators, targeting mostly farmers through job conditions and quality of life indicators. Processing stage tools (5) target mostly workers, through quantitative indicators related to fair job conditions. The wholesaler stage tools (4) and indicators are the least connected, while the retail stage (2) is the most inclusive in terms of qualitative social sustainability indicators. The consumer stage tools (2) also has a low number of social indicators and interactions, despite being the stage that influences the supply chain the most. It is clear that food supply chain stakeholders can benefit from the implementation of social sustainability aspects, although these benefits become inconsistent if not respected in each stage. A need for an unceasing thread of respected social sustainability should permeate the whole supply chain, as environmental certification currently does, becoming the priority for policy makers in the sector to focus their attention on the emerged hotspots for intervention from this research.},

  abstract = {The bioeconomy is a worldwide used strategy to cope with ecological, social, and economic sustainability challenges. However, we analyze current bioeconomy strategies and trends to point out potential sustainability conflicts and transition challenges. Our analysis shows that the bioeconomy is not sustainable per se, as mere input substitution may entail welfare losses. Instead, it requires further debates and actions to avoid exacerbation of ecological and social strains. Sustainability has to be the key concept behind the bioeconomy and predominantly requires (1) sustainability of the resource base and (2) sustainability of processes and products, especially by (3) circular processes of material fluxes, not least to gain consumer acceptance for bio-based products. Otherwise, the bioeconomy would only entail the substitution of fossil resources for bio-based resources potentially lacking the generation of additional societal and ecological benefits and contribution to climate mitigation. As markets alone will not suffice to fulfil this path transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy, we argue that innovative governance is necessary to reduce competitive drawbacks compared to fossil resources (enabling function) and to secure ecological, social, and economic sustainability requirements (limiting function).},

TT are defined as major, long-term technological changes in the way societal functions are fulfilled.

This paper practices ‘appreciative theory’ [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Bellknap Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982] and brings together insights from evolutionary economics and technology studies. This results in a multi-level perspective on TT where two views of the evolution are combined: (i) evolution as a process of variation, selection and retention, (ii) evolution as a process of unfolding and reconfiguration. The perspective is empirically illustrated with a qualitative longitudinal case-study, the transition from sailing ships to steamships, 1780–1900. Three particular mechanisms in TT are described: niche-cumulation, technological add-on and hybridisation, riding along with market growth.},

The energy studies and modeling research that so often dominate academic and policy debates provide valuable insights into these transitions, but remain constrained by their focus on rational decision-making and their neglect of non-linear dynamics and broader social processes. This review describes insights from a complementary socio-technical approach that addresses the interdependent social, political, cultural, and technical processes of transitions. Focusing on the “multi-level perspective”, the paper conceptualizes transitions as arising from the alignment of processes within and between three analytical levels: niche innovations, socio-technical regimes, and the socio-technical landscape. This analytical framework is illustrated with a case study of the German electricity transition and is used to appraise low-carbon transitions in several other sectors. We end by articulating four lessons for managing low-carbon transitions.},

To accomplish this, we use a forest sector model that includes the suppliers and major users of roundwood. The econometric results, based on a data set that spans 40 years, show that all the own price elasticities have the expected signs. Among the three forestry products, the supply and (long-term) demand of forest fuel seems to be most sensitive to a price change. In a second step, the estimated model is used to simulate the effect of increased forest conservation - the Sustainable Forest objective - on the supply of wood fuel. If oil is used as a substitute, Swedish emissions of greenhouse gases will increase by almost 0.92 percent, which indicates a clear conflict with the Reduced Climate Impact objective.

  abstract = {The literature on new technology diffusion is vast, and it spills over many conventional disciplinary boundaries. This paper surveys the literature by focusing on alternative explanations of the dominant stylized fact: that the usage of new technologies over time typically follows an S-curve. The most commonly found model which is used to account for this model is the so-called epidemic model, which builds on the premise that what limits the speed of usage is the lack of information available about the new technology, how to use it and what it does. The leading alternate model is often called the probit model, which follows from the premise that different firms, with different goals and abilities, are likely to want to adopt the new technology at different times. In this model, diffusion occurs as firms of different types gradually adopt it. There are actually many ways to generate an S-curve, and the third class of models which we examine are models of density dependence popularized by population ecologists. In these models, the twin forces of legitimation and competition help to establish new technologies and then ultimately limit their take-up. Finally, we look at models in which the initial choice between different variants of the new technology affect the subsequent diffusion speed of the chosen technology. Such models often rely on information cascades, which drive herd like adoption behaviour when a particular variant is finally selected.},

The co-existence of diametrically opposite interpretations of the concept indicates lack of a serious discussion of its theoretical foundations. Two narratives on circular bioeconomy are explored in depth: (i) the new economic paradigm based on technological progress (the economics of technological promises) that seeks perpetual economic growth; (ii) an entropic (thermodynamic) narrative that reflects on the limits on economic growth imposed by nature. The latter narrative makes a distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary resource flows and helps to identify what can and cannot be re-circulated within the metabolic pattern of social-ecological systems. Adopting the biophysical view, it becomes clear that the industrial revolution represented a linearization of material and energy flows with the goal to overcome the low pace and density of biological transformations. The required level of productivity of production factors in contemporary developed economies (flows per hour of labor and per hectare of land use) is orders of magnitude larger than the pace and density of supply and sink capacity of natural processes. Relying on nature to ‘close the loop’ will simply slow down the economic process.},

  abstract = {In this paper I rehearse the thinking steps J. K Gibson-Graham developed in order to theorize diverse economies and reveal a landscape of economic difference. Reading with and against Clifford Geertz’s 1973 essay “Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture,” I discuss how “thick description” of diverse economic practices can be combined with weak theory to produce a performative rethinking of economy centered on the well-being of people and the planet. I discuss the difficulties of resisting the influence of “strong theory”—that is, powerful discourses that organize events into understandable and seemingly predictable trajectories. I outline the diverse economy, a reframing that allows for a much wider range of social relations to be seen to bear on economic practices including, to name just some, trust, care, sharing, reciprocity, cooperation, coercion, bondage, thrift, guilt, love, equity, self-exploitation, solidarity, distributive justice, stewardship, spiritual connection, and environmental and social justice. In the complexly overdetermined field of a diverse economy, we are invited to trace multiple dynamics at play. It is in the apprehension of these diverse determinations that ethnographic thick description comes into its own and leads the way toward rethinking the economy. For ethnographers today, no task is more important than to make small facts speak to large concerns, to make the ethical acts ethnography describes into a performative ontology of economy and the threads of hope that emerge into stories of everyday revolution.},

Why is that? Structural barriers such as a climate-averse infrastructure are part of the answer, but psychological barriers also impede behavioral choices that would facilitate mitigation, adaptation, and environmental sustainability. Although many individuals are engaged in some ameliorative action, most could do more, but they are hindered by seven categories of psychological barriers, or “dragons of inaction”: limited cognition about the problem, ideological worldviews that tend to preclude pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, comparisons with key other people, sunk costs and behavioral momentum, discredence toward experts and authorities, perceived risks of change, and positive but inadequate behavior change. Structural barriers must be removed wherever possible, but this is unlikely to be sufficient. Psychologists must work with other scientists, technical experts, and policymakers to help citizens overcome these psychological barriers.

  abstract = {The Government of Canada aims at reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by 30\% by 2030 (compared to 2005) and reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Several of the climate actions under development would incentivize an increased use of forest biomass for energy. However, lessons learned from bioenergy policies worldwide have shown that increasing the use of bioenergy can impact the forest sector as a whole and that the carbon impacts of bioenergy should be assessed holistically to limit unintended negative consequences. This study aims to summarize and present existing data in a manner that enables the Canadian government and stakeholders to identify bioenergy pathways that can contribute to Canada's decarbonization targets. Firstly, we synthetize existing statistical datasets on wood removals and uses into a holistic picture of wood flows across Canada's economy. We find that, in 2017, a minimum of 77.7~Mm3 of wood were used for energy in Canada, and that reported quantities of wood used exceeded the amount of wood removals by 14–33~Mm3 annually. Thus, while 72\% of wood used for energy in 2017 derived from secondary industry residues, the origin of 26\% of wood for energy cannot be identified, seriously hindering any consideration on the sustainability of the current forest bioenergy use in Canada. Secondly, we assess that the amount of wood used for energy might increase by 5.5–20.4~Mm3 by 2030. In order to identify the potential impacts of this extra bioenergy demand on GHG emissions, we reviewed relevant literature based on our qualitative analysis of the system dynamics of the forest sector in response to such an increased demand. Our results show that unless targeted measures are defined to stimulate the use of residues, it is possible that direct and indirect biogenic GHG emissions from increased use of forest bioenergy will undermine Canada's decarbonization goals. We recommend several measures to avoid this, including: discouraging the dedicated harvest of logs for bioenergy, prioritizing the collection and use of logging residues which are usually burned at roadside, and favoring the recovery and use of post-consumer wood. In addition, we recommend improving the consistency among statistical datasets on Canada's forestry sector.},

For creating higher value chains, technological innovations are sought in the field of lignocellulosic biorefining. Although biorefinery concepts have been under development for decades now in Germany, many relevant technological developments are still confined to the laboratory and pilot scale. By taking on a technological innovation systems (TIS) approach, this article provides an empirical analysis of the development of lignocellulosic biorefineries in Germany, as well as prospects and implications for the forest and wood sector. Specific attention is accorded to actors' perceptions, in particular regarding the direction of innovation. To this end, we discuss the conditions under which actors from different sectors (forest and wood industry, chemical industry and energy sector) interact and play different roles in the emerging field. The analysis highlights a number of internal and external system weaknesses (e.g., fragmented policies, underdeveloped market formation, technological immaturity, incomplete actor networks etc.). However, we argue that the innovation system presents a series of strengths as well. Besides the clear need for policy integration and coordination, the analysis highlights some specific policy options that could support the development of lignocellulosic biorefineries in Germany.

Albeit prior research provides a rich repertoire of theoretical frameworks on how incumbent firms and entrepreneurs deal with uncertainty, there is still scant literature on the role of the government in orchestrating uncertainty concerning market formation. By studying multiple cases involving an innovation agency and municipalities in Brazil, we propose a new framework composed of a distinguishing typology of uncertainties and patterns of actions regarding how the government can orchestrate the mitigation of these uncertainties in market formation in sustainability transitions. Government actors cope with configurational uncertainty through boundary experimentation, affiliation uncertainty by removing barriers, and interdependence uncertainty by setting long-term mechanisms (nurturing, facilitating and driving interdependence). Our framework suggests that government actors adopt strategies to increase their legitimacy in driving market formation under uncertainty and use epistemic regulation to mitigate hypes. Implications and opportunities for further research are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Agriculture stands as the foundation of modern human societies. Any changes in social functioning should seriously consider how to guarantee people a proper supply of food, in terms of both quantity and quality. Degrowth is a movement that aims at achieving a radical change in the societal metabolism of societies, toward a more frugal, sustainable and convivial lifestyle. The movement envisages a society where concepts as sharing, conviviality, care, commons, justice could stand at its foundation, and replace the call for economic growth, which is, obviously, biophysically unsustainable. This paper aims to (1) review how agriculture has been addressed within the degrowth discourse, (2) analyse the relation between agriculture and societal metabolism and its relevance from a degrowth perspective, (3) discuss how different agricultural techniques and technologies may represent appropriate technologies (sensu Schumacher, 1973), and meet the call for conviviality (sensu Illich, 1975). The latter point focusses on a comparison between organic agriculture (OA, which bans the use of agrochemicals and Genetically Modified Organisms - GMOs) and biotech-based agriculture (BTA, reliant on GMOs). The paper points out that although many relevant socioeconomic, political and environmental issues have been addressed by degrowth scholars, agriculture is still poorly analysed. Recommendations are made with regard to studying possible alternative transition paths, by assessing their impact on society's structure and functioning. It is argued that “conviviality” and “appropriate technology” concepts are rather complex and multifaceted. Therefore, different practices might be considered convivial and appropriate under some criteria, and not under others. With regard to conviviality, organic agriculture might not fully respond to the call for autonomy. Notwithstanding claims made by GMOs supporters, BTA does neither suit the call for appropriate technology, nor represent a convivial tool under any criteria.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines the concept of environmental sustainability (ES), shows why it is important to make it a top-priority goal, and why that will be difficult to attain but essential. The ES equation of impact = population x affluence x technology, is outlined. When the world approaches stability in both population size and the throughput of energy and materials per unit of production, we may indeed be approaching sustainability. As the world's population is apt to double every 40 years, and as only a few countries (e.g. Japan and Sweden) have managed so far to reduce the energy intensity or production, we are hurtling away from sustainability rather than even approaching it, Environmental sustainability can be approached by implementing four priorities: first, by using sound microeconomic means; second, by using sound macroeconomics to differentiate between use and liquidation of natural capital by means of environmental accounting; third, by using environmental assessment to incorporate environmental costs into project appraisal; and fourth - until the first three become fully achieved - by following operational guidelines for sustainability. Thus: 1) Sound Microeconomic Aleans involve: (1) Getting the prices right: to reflect full social marginal opportunity cost; use the `full cost' principle, or the `cradle-to-grave' approach. (2) Repealing perverse fiscal incentives. (3) Strengthening the `polluter pays' principles. (4) Including non-monetary values in project justification- (5) Adopting the transparency principle that markets can function efficiently only if relevant information is available at low cost. This involves the participation of people in decisions affecting them, and advertising who is polluting what and by how much. 2) Sound Macroeconomics by Environmental Accounting is essential to discern decapitalization and to shift to using income rather than drawing down capital assets. Environmental accounting clarifies what is liquidation of natural capital from what is income. This is essential because decapitalization is frequently confused as income. Environmental accounting warns us when liquidation of potentially renewable resources exceeds their regeneration rates, such as in many forests. 3) Environmental Assessment is part of the project selection process. The purpose of EA is to ensure that the development options under consideration are environmentally sustainable. Any environmental consequences should be addressed in project selection, planning, siting, and design. EAs identify ways of preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for, adverse impacts. 4) Sustainability Guidelines: Until the first three rules are heeded and duly acted on, the following guidelines will be necessary: 1, Output Rule: - waste emissions from a project should be within the assimilative capacity of the local environment to absorb without unacceptable degradation of its future waste-absorptive capacity; and 2, Input Guide: - harvest rates or renewable resource inputs should be within regenerative capacity of the natural system that generates them. Depletion rates of non-renewable resource inputs should not exceed the rate at which renewable substitutes are developed by human invention and investment.},

  abstract = {Paper and pulp industries consume huge amount of resources like wood and water every year and creates large amounts of solid wastes and waste water that have to be treated. Different forms of wastes are produced such as particle, solid, gas, and water during paper production. The developed wastes are usually not treated properly and waste water is mostly allowed to mix with water resources like river. So identification of some suitable methodologies to treat these wastes in an environmental-friendly way and to extract the energy from these wastes is the need of the day. This chapter focuses on the history of paper making, paper making methodologies, forms of waste generated along with their sources, and characteristics followed by the techniques for converting these wastes into useful energy. Incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and biodiesel production methodologies for converting paper mill wastes into energy are discussed and it is found that anaerobic digestion is a commonly used method for wastewater, whereas incineration is for solid wastes. The possibility of producing biofuels from these wastes was also found as feasible.},

Focus is given to the sustainability of biomass and the circularity of materials. However, in order to facilitate the transition toward a sustainable bio-based circular economy and to unlock its potential, strong accompanying measures are required. These should be designed based on a systematic understanding of transition drivers and barriers. This paper, after providing a systematic review of transition research on the circular bioeconomy, focuses on the identification and classification of transition barriers, clustering them into relevant categories. Moreover, it provides a comparison of the barriers identified by various frameworks.},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.},

  abstract = {The "resource curse" is a potential threat to all countries relying on export income from abundant natural resources such as fossil fuels. The early literature hypothesized that easily accessible natural resources would lead to lack of technological progress. In this article we instead propose that abundance of fossil fuels can lead to the wrong type of technological progress. In order to inquire into our research question, we build a model of a small, open economy having specialized in export of fossil fuels. R\&D in fossil fuel extraction technology competes with R\&D in clean energy technologies. Moreover, technological progress is path dependent as current R\&D within a technology type depends on past R\&D within the same type. Finally, global climate policy may reduce the future value of fossil fuel export. We find that global climate policy may either lead to a resource curse or help the country escaping a potential resource curse. The ripeness of the clean energy technologies is essential for the outcomes: If the clean technology level is not too far beyond the fossil fuel technology, a shift to exporting clean energy is optimal independent of global climate policy and climate policy can accelerate this shift. While if the clean technology is far behind, a shift should only happen as a response to global climate policy, and the government should intervene to accelerate this shift.},

Various lag-length selection procedures have been suggested and evaluated in the literature. In these evaluations the possibility that the true model may have unequal lag-length has, however, received little attention. In this paper we investigate how sensitive laglength estimation procedures, based on assumptions of equal or unequal lag-lengths, are to the true model structure. The procedures used in the paper are based on information criteria and we give results for AIC, HQ and BIC. In the Monte Carlo study we generate data from a variety of VARmodels with properties similar to macro-economic time-series. We …nd that the commonly used procedure based on equal lag-length together with AIC and HQ performs well in most cases. The procedure (due to Hsiao) allowing for unequal lag-lengths produce reasonable results when the true model has unequal lag-length. The Hsiao procedure also tend to do better in models with a more complicated lag structure.},

This paper reviews studies in economics on efficient design of policies for forest carbon sequestration and compares their findings against design systems in practice. Specific design problems are associated with the heterogeneity of landowners, uncertainty, additionality, and permanence in carbon projects. Different types of discounting of the value of the forest carbon sink compared with emissions abatement are suggested in the literature for management of most design problems, together with optimal contract design and emissions baselines for managing additionality and permanence in carbon sequestration. Design systems in practice, where forest carbon corresponds to 0.5\% of all carbon volume subject to a pricing mechanism, mainly rely on additionality tests by approved standards on a project-by-project basis, and on buffer credits for management of permanence. Further development of forest carbon sinks as offsets in voluntary and compliance markets can be facilitated by applying tools for contract design and offset baseline management recommended in the literature.},

Such policy aims at system-wide transformation and is often referred to as system innovation policy. While insights from transition studies have provided novel and useful rationales for innovation policy targeting systemwide transformation, it remains unclear how to design, implement and evaluate such policies. The contribution of this paper is to translate and concretize the challenges of system innovation policy towards scope for policy action and analysis. Building on insights from transition studies we group the challenges into four domains: directionality, experimentation, demand articulation, and policy coordination and learning. We relate challenges within the four domains to three generic features of innovation systems: interests and capabilities of actors, networks, and institutions. The derived framework is applied in a case study on the strategic innovation programmes, a recent policy initiative by Vinnova, Sweden’s Innovation Agency, targeting system innovation.},

We estimate the IPF with patent applications as R\&D output, allowing for a flexible treatment of unit productivity of R\&D capital and R\&D labor. We find that the elasticity of substitution between R\&D input factors is 0.7 − 0.8 and significantly below unity. This implies that R\&D capital is an essential factor in producing ideas, complementary to R\&D labor. We also identify a systematic positive trend in R\&D labor productivity at about 1\% per year on average and a cyclical trend in R\&D capital productivity. Our results suggest that instead of ‘ideas getting harder to find’, there is an increasing scarcity of R\&D capital needed to find them.},

  abstract = {This article aims to understand the possible preconditions for the transformation of a regional innovation system (RIS) into a quadruple and quintuple helix system applied to the development of a sustainable forestry-based bioeconomy in Varmland, Sweden. Research points to the necessity not only of further developing current innovation systems to include more actors than earlier but also of taking concern for the environment as a way towards attaining sustainability. The research was carried out in response to the need to understand the fourth helix and its role in RIS and to transform to a sustainable bioeconomy, as identified by researchers, policymakers and industry representatives. This study was inspired by participatory transdisciplinarity and a transdisciplinary research design, acknowledging the importance of a variety of actors in knowledge production from different spheres of society. Much of the empirical material gathered for this research was based on interviews and a workshop with different stakeholders. The results show that the use of a quintuple helix RIS in Varmland for the transformation to a forestry-based bioeconomy could be a possible way forward towards sustainability. The model proposes that involvement of civil society in the innovation system could contribute to a larger societal transformation that aims to change consumer behaviour, production patterns, technological developments, infrastructure, norms and values. However, the involvement of civil society in the innovation system must still be regarded as part of a vision statement in regional policy documents.},

  abstract = {The current controversies on “sustainable growth”, “green growth” and “degrowth” cover many issues in the relations between human behavior, societal regulation and technology in face of the need to overcome the environmental crisis. The point of departure of this paper is the observation that the roles of technology and of technological progress in realizing an ecologically sound development often are simply taken as mere assumptions or else are taken for granted. The objective of this paper is to critically scrutinize assumptions and expectations of the eco-modernist approach from the perspective of technology assessment in the context of the debate on growth and degrowth. By reconstructing the basic arguments, assumptions, and premises of the eco-modernist approach and their critical assessment, the analysis culminates in the diagnosis of the eco-modernist approach being morally hazardous because it expects to overcome the ecological crisis by technological progress and its acceleration only, ignoring the ambivalences of technology and the issue of unintended side effects. Following this result, conclusions will be drawn in two directions: from the experience of technology assessment for degrowth, and from degrowth thinking for technology assessment.},

  abstract = {Conventional economic systems are based on the unsustainable use of natural resources. Circular Economy is a framework for socio-technical regime change that prioritizes material loops to improve resource efficiency. The framework promotes business activities that capitalize on material recirculation pathways and extended product life cycles. Many countries have begun adopting Circular Economy principles through policies, targets, and action plans, but research in this area has focused largely on developed countries and major emerging economies. The lack of scientific analysis of Circular Economy implementation in developing countries is a critical research gap with significant implications on global material flows. Fast-growing countries such as the Philippines will benefit from the regime change towards Circular Economy to resolve sustainability issues from economic and demographic trends. Policy interventions need to be calibrated to enable a smooth transition to circularity. To address this gap, this study uses a 16-sector Environmentally-Extended Input-Output model to simulate four scenarios on a) increasing product demand, b) implementing circular business models, c) implementing government regulations, and d) promoting service sectors. GDP growth, material intensity, and regulatory constraints of each scenario are analyzed. Results show a potential of up to 10.05\% increase in GDP and 62.51\% decrease in material footprint relative to business-as-usual. Policy implications on the Philippines' transition to a Circular Economy are discussed.},

Despite this, limited empirical research describes why and how forest and other sector (e.g., textiles, energy, or plastics, etc.) companies choose to collaborate. This study documents factors impacting the formation and implementation as well as the outcomes of collaborations between forest and other sector companies for developing new products. A qualitative, multi-case study is used to profile four collaborations involving eight companies operating in North America, Europe, and Asia. In two of the collaborations, partners chose not to attempt commercialization of the product/technology that was the focus of the collaboration, while two collaborations are ongoing. Results suggest that turbulent environments and desire to be ahead of competitors are the main reasons for forest sector companies to collaborate. Collaborations resulted in enhanced learning, intellectual property creation, enhanced value, and culture change, even when the primary goal of the collaboration was not realized.},

In this study we examined existing research that specified causal claims about the outcomes of sustained environmental collective action and analysed the collective action characteristics associated with the stated outcomes. Of the 640 studies identified in our literature search, 113 papers examined environmental collective action outcomes over a time period of one or more years. In total, 59 different environmental collective action outcomes were identified, including changing corporate/business practices (n~=~16), achieving political outcomes (n~=~12), fostering movement building (n~=~8), development project-specific outcomes (n~=~8), physical changes such as increased forest cover (n~=~7), or changes in public opinion, values, or behaviours (n~=~4). In terms of general outcomes (i.e., success of failure of environmental collective action) the most common outcome claimed was both success and failure (n~=~44), followed by complete success (n~=~37) and mostly failure (n~=~18). All papers identified the use of normative collective action, while 36 papers mentioned non-violent non-normative action such as blockades and sit-ins. Across the dataset there was a lack of consistency in descriptive terminology, methodological approach and inclusion of empirical evidence in justifying causal claims. We close with recommendations for scholars’ best practices for advancing research into environmental collective action outcomes, namely: consistent terminology, mapping outcomes against goals, increased studies of failure, and diversifying studies in non-WEIRD contexts.},

Trees are set aside for biodiversity purposes at multiple scale levels varying from individual trees to areas of thousands of hectares, with landowner responsibility at the lowest level and with increasing state involvement at higher levels. Ecological theory supports the multi-scaled approach, and retention efforts at every harvest occasion stimulate landowners’ interest in conservation. We argue that the model has large advantages but that in a future with intensified forestry and global warming, development based on more progressive thinking is necessary to maintain and increase biodiversity. Suggestions for the future include joint planning for several forest owners, consideration of cost-effectiveness, accepting opportunistic work models, adjusting retention levels to stand and landscape composition, introduction of temporary reserves, creation of “receiver habitats” for species escaping climate change, and protection of young forests.},

System Dynamics (SD) facilitates coping with increased complexity by enabling closed-loop thinking via identifying the causal structures underlying behaviour and permitting to proactively experiment with the system through simulation. This research aims to propose and test an SD-based framework for examining CE transitions to supporting decision-making at the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. Two inductive model-based cases studies led to formalising the framework, finally tested in a third deductive model-based case study. The framework is built upon the well-known stages for building SD simulation models and complemented with domain-specific activities, guiding questions, and expected outcomes when examining CE transitions. The SD-based framework is the first modelling-oriented prescriptive approach to help researchers and practitioners examining CE transitions on their journeys to understand and facilitate changes through SD simulation models.},

We identify five main distinguishing TIP characteristics and analyse the literature’s understanding of how they influence the policymaking process. The analysis shows that the literature discusses TIPrelated challenges in all stages of the policy cycle but does not provide much guidance on how to address key cross-cutting policymaking challenges such as how to achieve broad stakeholder involvement, evaluate transformative outcomes, and build up dynamic policymaker capabilities. In order for TIP ideas to be implemented in real-life policymaking, TIP scholars, therefore, need to more explicitly consider the practitioners’ perspective and develop concrete models, tools and guidelines that help policymakers address the identified challenges.},

These claims, however, are asserted much more often than they are backed up, and little attention has been devoted to thinking through how they might be substantiated or to what ?the commodification of everything? actually means. This paper contributes to contemporary debates over capitalism, commodification and politics by suggesting ways that commodification-of-everything arguments can be better specified and evaluated. It identifies four variants of commodification-of-everything claims; reviews and critiques the literature's uses of the terms ?commodity?, ?everything? and ?thing?; and articulates three possible definitions of ?the commodification of everything? that raise additional questions about defining ?sale? and ?market? and the implications of thinking of things as commodities. The conclusion suggests reframings of the relationship between capitalism and commodification that seek to preserve the force of commodification-of-everything claims while avoiding their pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Forests and forest-based bioeconomy have central roles in the contemporary sustainability transition. However, the transition towards a bioeconomy is loaded with tensions regarding economic growth, ecological integrity, and social justice. These tensions reproduce varying transition discourses. Political actors at the level of the European Union (EU) and nation states take part in the processes creating the discourses and aim to govern the forest bioeconomy-based transition in certain directions viewed as favourable. The transition tensions are strongly felt in regions that are rich with forest resources but poor in terms of economic and political power, called ‘forest peripheries’. In this study, we explored how the forest bioeconomy discourses are downscaled in the development of the forest peripheries in East and North Finland. We examined the ways in which the regional development actors interpret prevailing forest-related policies and reproduce or challenge associated forest discourse(s). The focus was on the linkages between the macro-policies and the regional development, uncertainties that relate to the practical implementation and realisation of the policies, and the conflicts and power relations between the policies, practices, and the actors behind them. As a research strategy, we used embedded triangulation, where the interviews of development actors as initial data were contrasted with policy documents as the supportive data.For the analysis, we used the critical discourse analysis. From the policy documents, we identified the ‘You can have it all (if you close your eyes)’ discourse as the most hegemonic discourse, which aims to merge all the sides under the sustainable forest bioeconomy that favours the biomass regime. From the interviews, we identified three interlinked regional forest bioeconomy discourses: 1) ‘You can have it all is possible’, 2) ‘You can have it all is dependent on many ifs’, and 3) ‘You can have it all runs into conflicts’. The first discourse reproduced the hegemonic discourse, power relations appeared to be vertically unproblematic, and relatively manifested just transition for the forest peripheries. The second discourse produced an alternative discourse, which displayed more dependencies on the qualities of economic actors under the biotech regime. Power relations appeared to be more horizontal and complex, with a random just transition. The third discourse manifested tensions between the ideological aspirations of the policies and the practical reality in the forest peripheries. Conflicts arise from disharmonies between policy implementation and regional needs, cultural clashes, and misrecognition of the regional perspectives. The discourse reflected skewed power relations in vertical and horizontal manners. The transition appeared to be unjust in many ways because the external benefits seemed to be regarded over the regional ones.},

Informants typically assume that researchers are aiming to document their experiences, feelings, perspectives, etc., as features of a collectively shared world; an assumption that is probably reinforced by the rationales researchers provide, and by their behaviour. Yet, in such studies, the purpose of interviews is actually to generate displays of discursive practices, rather than to elicit information about the world or about people’s individual subjectivities. This discrepancy amounts to deception, but attempts to remedy it are likely to be counterproductive because of the gap between the natural attitude and a constructionist analytic orientation. From the perspective of some currently influential views about ethics, relating to informed consent and doing research ‘with’ rather than ‘on’ people, this would disqualify such research. However, these views are by no means beyond challenge. In these terms, discourse analysis poses important questions about currently accepted views of research ethics.},

It is argued that exergy is a more easily understood thermodynamic property than is entropy to represent irreversibilities in complex systems, and that the behaviour of energy and matter are not equally mirrored by thermodynamic laws. Thermodynamic insights as typically employed in ecological economics are simply analogues or metaphors of reality. They should therefore be empirically tested against the real world.},

  abstract = {The concept of degrowth aims fundamentally at reducing material and energy throughput equitably, while questioning the desirability of further economic growth. In order to achieve this reduction of society’s throughput, radical changes in the ways goods and services are produced, distributed and used are required. In this think piece, concepts of consumer integration into the value creation process and (new) enabling technologies are discussed as possible constituting elements of alternative organizational models in a degrowth society. To date, collaborative value creation concepts, such as crowdsourcing and mass customization, have been discussed almost exclusively as business model patterns for companies in economies that are set to grow. The same applies to the assessment of (new) technologies, such as additive manufacturing, web-based user interfaces for co-creation, and other flexible production technologies that allow for collaborative and individualized production. Potential positive and negative effects of these concepts and technologies with regard to the objectives of degrowth are discussed in order to initiate a debate about the inclusion of CVC for the design of alternative organizational models that are in line with degrowth thinking. This think piece illustrates that several elements of collaborative value creation and its enabling technologies coincide with degrowth objectives but do not lead per se to their attainment. Thereby, a starting point for future (empirical) work in this area is generated.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

Despite the rather long occurrence and use of the concept of ecosystem services we do not yet have enough information on the status and economic value of services in Swedish forests. The value of the forest ecosystem services is at best an indication of the different multifunctional objectives that should be met in the management of the Swedish forests. The five most central ecosystem services in Swedish forests according to annual flow are timber and pulpwood, bioenergy, game, climate regulation and recreation and training, each estimated to have a monetary value of several billion SEK. The different ecosystem services in multipurpose forests interact with each other and may lead to conflicts between use and conservation. We identified a number of trade-offs and synergies between services focusing on the five above ecosystem services.},

While the geography of eco-innovations field focuses on local and regional conditions that enable the emergence of environmentally friendly technologies and industries, research on the geography of sustainability transitions highlights the place-specific but multiscalar nature of socio-technical change, taking into account the role of different actor groups. The review identifies numerous complementarities between both fields that may serve as starting points to further integrate geographical work on eco-innovations and transformative change.},

Therefore, with an emphasis on so-called strong sustainability, this article's purpose was to investigate social innovation's potential in relation to ecological crises, to identify important gaps, and advance research implications. A systematic literature review of social innovation research that address environmental issues was carried out, and the resulting literature was analyzed according to sustainability and five dimensions of social innovation.

It is in these and in many other ways that the conflicting tenets of the three leading models, derived in turn from the theories and concepts of Thomas Malthus, Karl Marx, and Adam Smith, continue to influence the ways in which people regard the medieval centuries.},

By charting the changed demographic, socio-economic and geographic profile of the NIPF owners, it also provides a baseline for a discussion and analysis of potential implications for forest management, policy and values. NIPF owners differ in important ways from the general population of Sweden. However, the gap has narrowed over time with regard to, e.g., educational level and sex composition. The ongoing urbanization process is evident in the growing share of non-residential NIPF owners who live at a distance from their forest property and who differ from their residential (rural) peers through, e.g., higher education, higher income and a higher prevalence of co-ownership of their forest holdings. Although these changes might translate into updated views on forest values among NIPF owners, there could be a delay before this impacts on forest management practices and output.},

  abstract = {Eco-innovation has become an essential entity for greening the economy. Technological innovations, institutional reforms, and change in social practices are some of the means of eco-innovation. As a result, there is a wide discourse on the many dimensions of eco-innovation since the dawn of the millennium. However, the concept of eco-innovation lacks theoretical consistency; hence, it has remained narrow and disintegrated. Therefore, this study conducts a systematic review of the articles focusing on the significance of theories in relation to the process of eco-innovation, in order to investigate the evolving theories of eco-innovation, highlight the existing research gaps, and to identify directions for potential theoretical development that would be valuable for a deeper system change. The findings show resource-based view, institutional theory, stakeholders theory, and evolutionary theory to be the most commonly used theories, along with identification of material-based enterprises as the primary sectors of implementation exhibiting a strong technological bias. The findings indicate that eco-innovations are primarily perceived from a narrow set of neo-liberal notions that although is effective for incremental improvements, lack credibility for defining the differentiated approach associated with radical eco-innovations. Accordingly, selective pressure by means of policy making process,~design dynamic, and societal demand are identified as gray areas requiring greater theoretical attention. An analytical framework built on technological, institutional, organizational and social eco-innovation is represented for exploring the research areas of system change, economic sustainability, product network sustainability, and socio-technical landscape, that facilitates sustainability transition.},

This paper builds on and further develops a recently proposed framework for studying global innovation systems (GIS). It aims at explaining the emergence of a GIS by outlining the specific local resource-related conditions that lead to the creation of structural couplings, i.e. actors, networks and institutions that allow for multi-scalar resource flows. Deploying a qualitative case study, the paper investigates the interrelated developments of eight demonstration sites of innovative wastewater treatment technology in North-Western Europe. It shows how resource-related deficits lead actors to draw on resources generated outside of their local context. The paper contributes to the literature on the Geography of Transitions by highlighting the importance of resource complementarities among different local contexts, as well as the crucial role of trans-local systemic intermediaries in shaping an emergent GIS.},

  abstract = {The large-scale ecological damage caused by growth societies calls for economic degrowth in terms of a radical decrease in matter/energy throughput. This article examines the role of modern technology in degrowth with a focus on the question of agency and its ethical implications. After conceptualising technology as practice, the paper finds that while technological practice encompasses an agency for social change, it is restricted to transforming the non-human world to human-made objects. This is because in technological practice the world and its objects unfold as a standing-reserve for human use. Due to this calculative and anthropocentric thinking, technological practice does not and cannot support the emergence of a kind of agency that either does or can let things be. Moreover, the more technological the practice, the more objects are utilised. The paper concludes that technological practice does not support the transition to degrowth, because it directs its agents towards the continuous transformation of non-human-made objects into human-made objects resulting in an increase in cumulative throughput. The paper thus suggests that an ethos of releasement is needed to attain, as well as to live in, a degrowth society. The rationale provided for refraining from the technological practice in order to contribute to ecologically sensible social change is the chief contribution of this paper.},

The aim of the bioeconomy is to substitute the use of fossil resources by renewable resources, while the SDGs set targets for a holistic sustainable global development. A literature-based influence analysis on empirical studies is employed to derive three bioeconomy scenarios (business as usual, bioeconomy, and sustainable bioeconomy) and to quantify their effects on the individual SDG targets. It is shown that the bioeconomy scenario has positive as well as negative effects on the SDG targets. While targets for cleaner industrial production are strongly supported, socioeconomic targets are subject to mixed effects and environmental targets significantly hurt. This paper outlines which SDGs need special attention when implementing a bioeconomy according to the above-mentioned concepts. The results add to the debate on SDG trade-offs and on the substitutability of SDG targets. Without regulations, policies, and investments ensuring sustainability, or in case the substitutability of SDG targets is not allowed, the bioeconomy concepts have the potential to jeopardize the achievement of several SDGs. In contrast, the sustainable bioeconomy scenario assumes strong sustainability measures that reveal the extensive potential of the bioeconomy to support the achievement of the SDGs.},

We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore, it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore, we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as dfunctions of innovation systemsT. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature, we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change. This method can be characterized as a process analysis or history event analysis. Clarifying examples are taken from the empirical field of Sustainable Technology Development.},

By formulating clear and ambitious societal goals, policy makers are aiming to steer the directionality and adoption of innovation. In the absence of suitable frameworks to understand and enhance the impact of missions, we introduce the notion of Mission-oriented Innovation Systems (MIS). MIS consists of networks of agents and sets of institutions that contribute to the development and diffusion of innovative solutions with the aim to define, pursue and complete a societal mission. We provide several promising research avenues, including how MIS come into existence, how they are governed and how the interactions taking place in a MIS may influence directionality and technological variety.},

This has delayed the transition to a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy. In this article, we adopt the technological innovation system (TIS) approach to analyze advanced biorefinery development in Sweden, a front-runner country in current development. The analysis highlights a number of system strengths (e.g., long-term research funding; significant research infrastructure; strong actor networks) that have contributed to developing the Swedish TIS, but also important system weaknesses (e.g., weak coordination among ministries; lack of industrial absorptive capacity; unclear roles) inhibiting it. The article highlights a combination of four policy measures that build on the system strengths to address the system weaknesses: (a) the implementation of a deployment policy for creating domestic niche markets; (b) improved policy timing and more structured coordination among different governmental agencies; (c) the provision of stronger incentives for mature industries to invest in R\&D and improve their absorptive capacity; and (d) improved organization and financing of existing research infrastructure. In addition to the empirical contribution, the article contributes with novel insights into the TIS framework by highlighting the dynamics between system strengths and weaknesses, and suggests that system strengths should be better emphasized in future TIS studies.},

Results indicate that the responding architects find concrete the most suitable frame material in buildings of 3-8 storeys, mainly because of the performance of concrete with regards to the engineering aspects (e.g. stability and fire safety) that were considered important in the choice of frame material. Although wood is considered the least suitable frame material, the overall attitude towards, and interest in, using wood is positive and related to the perceived environmental benefits of wood. This may derive from an increased discussion of and information about the environmental impact of buildings. Wood may be perceived as new and innovative while not considered as adequately proven as steel and concrete with regards to engineering aspects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Sustainability is becoming essential for virtually every organization willing to thrive in a globalized world. Nonetheless, the available resources to address the challenges required to switch towards sustainability-oriented firms are scarce and yet necessary to deploy. Thus, this study focuses on the adoption of ISO 9000, ISO 14000 and OHSAS 18001 families of standards as managerial practices that can help firms in promoting eco-product innovation, considering slack resources as a moderator of this relationship. Relying on a sample composed of 2834 firms studied between years 2007 and 2020 and obtained from the Refinitiv® Eikon database, results suggest that firms holding these certifications are more prone to eco-product innovation. More specifically, ISO 14000 acts as the main driver, although its benefits are boosted when implemented in combination with ISO 9000 and/or OHSAS 18001. In fact, firms adopting multiple certifications increasingly use their slack resources to leverage eco-product innovation when firms hold at least intermediate levels of slack. All in all, this is one of the first studies, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, analyzing simultaneously the different combinations of these certifications as potential drivers of eco-product innovation, as well as the moderating role of slack resources.},

The article offers a broad overview of many pressing challenges and opportunities that the Big Data era raises particularly for qualitative research. Big Data has introduced to the social sciences new data sources, new research methods, new researchers, and new forms of data storage that have immediate and potential effects on the ethics and practice of qualitative research. Drawing from a literature review and insights gathered at a National Science Foundation-funded workshop in 2016, we present five principles for qualitative researchers and their institutions to consider in navigating these emerging research landscapes. These principles include (a) valuing methodological diversity; (b) encouraging research that accounts for and retains context, specificity, and marginalized and overlooked populations; (c) pushing beyond legal concerns to address often messy ethical dilemmas; (d) attending to regional and disciplinary differences; and (e) considering the entire lifecycle of research, including the data afterlife in archives or in open-data facilities.},

Through an analysis of the drivers and barriers of both processes, this article identifies key factors that explain the difference in outcome. It becomes clear: transformation strategies should aim to create regulatory frameworks that make it attractive to invest in sustainable alternatives.This article compares the drivers and barriers of two sustainability transformations in Germany: the energy transformation (“Energiewende”) and the attempted transformation towards organic agriculture which has, so far, been less successful. It is based on two case studies rooted in transformation research. While there is rapidly growing literature on energy, there are far fewer analyses of agricultural transformations. Moreover, single case studies dominate. The cross-case comparison presented in this article is a step towards filling this gap. Particularly in their initial stages, the two transformation processes shared similarities: both systems had been coming under pressure due to environmental crises, grassroots movements and niche developments of sustainable alternatives. However, changes to the regulatory system framework made investments in renewable energy more attractive than in organic agriculture, where the profitability of the transformation is still reduced by significant subsidies for conventional agriculture. Moreover, the energy transformation has benefitted from technological improvements and falling costs, an early coalition of supporters, including business actors, and more recently from a broader societal and political consensus.},

This paper uses microeconomic data to formulate a measure of an individual's relative income. The use of microeconomic data allows the researcher to control for both state fixed effects and cohort fixed effects, both have been absent in previous examinations of Easterlin's hypothesis. The results of the empirical analysis are consistent with Easterlin's assertion that relative income influenced fertility decisions, although the effect operates only through childhood income. When the estimated effects are contextualized, they explain 12\% of the U.S. baby boom.},

  abstract = {By using socio-technical scenarios, we investigate how present policy choices may affect the development of alternative transport fuels in Sweden. One important choice for policy lies in the balance between general tax exemptions stimulating the market for alternative fuels, and funding of research and development more directly promoting new technology. The implications of this choice are illustrated with four diverging development paths until 2020. In the market-oriented scenarios, we illustrate consequences of breaking the dominance of entrenched technologies and demonstrating a growing market potential for alternatives, but also the risks with a large focus on first generation renewable fuels. In the technology-oriented scenarios, we point out the value of keeping variety among niches in this stage of the transition. In conclusion, if policy is implemented without taking the dynamic forces within the system into account, there is a risk that any measure leads the system into a dead end. But if policy strives to balance the development in different parts of the technological system while making use of various prevailing forces of change, a multitude of different efforts can contribute to the development of a more sustainable transport system.},

The International Platform of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recommends pluralistic valuations of ecosystem services that include intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values. To understand how value pluralism may affect trade-offs between ecosystem services, we conducted a study quantifying ecosystem service proxies along a tree species diversity gradient in plantation forests in the coastal Pacific Northwest, USA. Further, we developed four frameworks emphasizing different bundles of ecosystem services based on how the services clumped within a matrix of value types and level of social organization at which benefits are likely to accrue. We then determined tree species compositions that optimized ecosystem services emphasized under the four frameworks. Some ecosystem services responded in sync, but we found trade-offs between provisioning services with primarily instrumental value and cultural services with relational values. Most single ecosystem services were maximized by monocultures. In contrast, high levels of tree species diversity supported the largest variety of value types. We hypothesized that biodiversity may be important not just for increasing ecosystem functions and services, but also for value pluralism.},

While the newest ICTs such as the internet are in some ways unique, in other respects they have historical predecessors (such as the telegraph and the telephone) that are worth considering. This paper reviews the literature and shows that ‘older’ ICTs have transformed our mobility regime in significant and unpredictable ways. In particular, they have supported and made more efficient new transport modes, contributed to the geographical concentration and dispersion trends of economic activities and changed how and how much we connect to our families and friends. ICTs can help building more sustainable mobility e.g., by making transport more efficient or reducing mobility demand in some cases, but overall the interactions between mobility and ICTs turn out to be important, diverse and complex.},

The second objective is conceptual in orientation and seeks to address how we understand transitions at the scale of the city, the role of ‘the city’ in undertaking transitions, and review both the strengths and shortcomings of the multi-level perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions in addressing this. The third objective is to identify what an urban transition would look like, and then constructs a new framework to conceptualise and research urban transitions. The paper then summarises the key aspects and implications of our argument.},

Forests provide multiple ecosystem services and natural solutions, including wood and fibre production, food, clear and clean water and air, animal and plant habitats, soil formation, aesthetics, and cultural and social services. Carbon sequestered by growing trees is a key factor in the envisaged transition from a fossil-based to a biobased economy. Here, we highlight the possibilities of forest-based solutions to mitigate current and emerging societal challenges. We discuss forestry effects on forest ecosystems, focusing on the optimisation of ES delivery and the fulfilment of UN SDGs while counteracting unwanted effects. In particular, we highlight the trilemma of (i) increasing wood production to substitute raw fossil materials, (ii) increasing forest carbon storage capacity, and (iii) improving forest biodiversity and other ES delivery.},

  abstract = {This review article examines how social science literature co-produces various imaginaries of forest-based bioeconomy transformations and pathways for reaching desired ends. Based on an analysis of 59 research articles, we find that despite a growing number of social sciences studies on the forest-based bioeconomy, much of the research tends to replicate a bioeconomy imaginary articulated in EU and national bioeconomy policies and strategies. Accordingly, the research primarily reproduces a weak approach to sustainability, which prioritize economic growth and competitiveness. Expectations are largely directed at national and regional corporate interests and forest industrial renewal, while the state has a supportive rather than restricting role. We discuss the findings against the role of social sciences, and conclude that social science scholars may adopt various strategies if interested in opening up forest-based policy debates and offer alternative imaginaries of sustainable bioeconomy transformations.},

We unpack emerging bioeconomies as discursive constructs and use the ‘apparatus of capture’ as a conceptual framework to understand and rethink the Swedish bioeconomy. Based on analysis of empirical data from multiple sources (e.g., online surveys, in-depth interviews, participatory observations), we identify a closed bioeconomy network structure that includes forest industries, major forest owner associations, regional councils and research institutes/universities. The network (re)produces three key storylines that appeal to the majority of parties in the national parliament, defines the boundaries of relevant expertise, and discredits environmental regulation and expertise. Through these storylines the Swedish bioeconomy is turned into an issue of innovation governance, which blurs the boundaries between public and private interests in forests. To counteract future capture, different types of knowledges and forest perspectives need further exploration in Swedish bioeconomy and forest governance.},

Transition and transformation are not mutually exclusive; they provide nuanced perspectives on how to describe, interpret and support desirable radical and non-linear societal change. Their differences may partially result from their etymological origins, but they largely stem from the different research communities concerned with either transition or transformation.

In broad terms, the concept of sustainable development is an attempt to combine growing concerns about a range of environmental issues with socio-economic issues. To aid understanding of these different policies this paper presents a classification and mapping of different trends of thought on sustainable development, their political and policy frameworks and their attitudes towards change and means of change. Sustainable development has the potential to address fundamental challenges for humanity, now and into the future. However, to do this, it needs more clarity of meaning, concentrating on sustainable livelihoods and well-being rather than well-having, and long term environmental sustainability, which requires a strong basis in principles that link the social and environmental to human equity.

  abstract = {Understanding and governing technology transitions is essential to cope with major challenges of the 21st century such as climate change or digitization. In this paper, a learning-based approach is developed to explain the dynamics of different transition pathways. Technological know-how is necessary to make effective use of technical innovations embodied in capital. Firms and employees accumulate technology specific knowledge when working with specific machinery. Radical innovation differs by technology type and pre-existing knowledge may be imperfectly transferable across types. This paper addresses the implications of cross-technology transferability of skills for firm-level technology adoption and its consequences for the direction of macro-level technological change. A microeconomically founded model of technological learning is introduced. The model is based on empirical and theoretical insights from the innovation literature. In a simulation study using the macro-economic ABM Eurace@unibi-eco and applied to the context of green 2 technology diffusion, it is shown that a high transferability of knowledge has ambiguous effects. It accelerates the diffusion process initially but comes at the cost of long-term technological stability and specialization. For firms, it is easy to adopt new technology, but also easy to switch back to the incumbent type. Technological instability can be macroeconomically costly.},

Using a two-layer network of input-output (market) and patent citations (innovation) links among 307 6-digit US manufacturing industries in 1977-2012, I study two mechanisms of TP and DP: (1) TP and DP are between-layer spillovers when demand shocks in the market pull innovation and innovation pushes growth in the market. (2) Within the same layer, DP arises from downstream links when output users trigger upstream growth, while TP effects spill over from up- to downstream industries. The results support between- and within-layer TP: innovation spillovers from upstream industries drive market growth and innovation. There is also support for within-market TP: positive upstream supply shocks may stimulate market growth, but this effect is heterogeneous across industries. DP is not supported, but the results show that DP forces are associated with a factor bias in favor of labor, while TP comes with a labor demand shift towards non-production work. The results enable a nuanced view on the drivers of technological change and its impact on labor, capital, and productivity. This may inform policy-makers on how to steer the technological evolution.},

  abstract = {Post-logging silvicultural treatments involving thinning are commonly recommended to increase the commercial timber production under polycyclic harvesting regimes in tropical forests. However, thinning practices intentionally designed to improve commercial timber production may alter species composition and functional composition. Low, medium, and high intensity thinning following logging plus a logged only control was applied in an Australian tropical forest in 1969 to assess the long-term liberation thinning impacts on the commercial timber volume and the functional composition of the regenerating forest. Over 46~years following thinning, only medium- and high-intensity thinning promoted recruitment of commercial trees into the~{$>$}10~cm diameter class. All three thinning treatments enhanced the standing volume of most desirable commercial species, mainly driven by the growth of remaining non-harvested trees in the 10–20~cm diameter class. The merchantable timber volume of other less desirable species was also promoted in the four treatments. Over the first 28~years after treatment (1969–1997), the average annual timber volume accumulation rate was highest in the medium-intensity thinning (1.97~m3~ha−1~year−1). The positive impacts of medium- and high-intensity thinning on commercial timber volume growth lasted longer than the low-intensity thinning. From 1997 to 2015, average annual volume increments increased in the medium- and high-intensity thinning, changed little in the low-intensity thinning, and decreased in the untreated control. Moreover, the medium- and high-intensity thinning led the community functional composition to shift towards early-successional species, which reduced community-weighted mean wood densities. The changes induced by intensive thinning treatments may affect the recovery of forest biomass and biodiversity. Hence, the trade-off between enhancing timber stocks and maintaining functional composition should be considered during planning and implementation of tropical forest management.},

  abstract = {As the second-largest economy in the world with both high-energy consumption and high‑carbon emission, China has launched several green finance pilot zones (GFPZ) targeting regional sustainable development goals (SDGs). Despite critical policy significance, whether and how green finance affects green innovation by enterprises still remains not well understood. Hence, using a difference-in-difference identification strategy and a micro-sample of A-share Chinese listed enterprises during 2007–2019, we investigated the aggregate casual effects of the GFPZ policy on green innovation quality. The empirical results show that the GFPZ policy has incentive and restraint effects on the enterprises' green innovation behavior. It substantially restricts enterprises from engaging in low-quality green innovation and encourages them to spur high-quality ones in the long run. Furthermore, we explore three plausible channels that may explain this beneficial effect; mitigating financial constraints, reducing transaction costs and intensifying peer-to-peer competition in research and development (R\&D). In addition, this effect is more pronounced for sub-samples of high-polluting industries, non-state-owned enterprises, and small, medium and micro enterprises. We further show that high-quality green innovation is a plausible mechanism that links green finance with regional green development through enhancing green productivity growth. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the real effects of green finance on green innovation and productivity growth in the context of SDGs.},

Until very recently, the approaches used in these studies have remained relatively unchanged. However, the global forest sector has been faced with major structural changes and its operating environment has become ever more complex and interlinked with other sectors. The aim of this article is to review the forest sector outlook approaches in face of these changes, and to analyze how well they have been able to capture and project the changes. Moreover, we raise the question of whether they seem informative enough for the purposes of today's decision makers and other stakeholders. The results indicate that the existing outlook studies have not been able to sufficiently capture the structural changes in global paper markets, and it may be that they have difficulties in considering the possible structural changes in other markets as well. In order to assess the changes occurring in the operating environment more systematically, and to better meet the needs of policy-makers and stakeholders, there are potential advantages in complementing the current modeling approach dominant in the forest sector with other methods from the field of foresight.},

The aim of this study is to elicit expert views on critical changes in the sector through an outlook towards 2030 and 2050, as well as to analyze how these views relate to the understanding of bioeconomy. The study employs a three-round Delphi survey with 41 experts representing different sectors and societal perspectives across Europe. Forty statements based on initial explorative interviews were evaluated by the panel in two consecutive rounds of web-based questionnaires. Results reveal the highest consensus among panellists relates to the diversification of the forest industries and the dependence of the sector on climate and energy policies. The greatest dispersion of expert opinions was found to relate to the possible discontinuation of bioenergy market growth, the possible segregation of forest management, change in forest ownership structure, and the shortage of biomass supply in the long–run. Additionally, the concept of bioeconomy was regarded by the majority as a vision for the future, rather than a depiction of real changes. Notably, major change regarding the significance of the sector, and specifically a transition towards a well-developed forest based bioeconomy, was not expected towards 2030 without significant change in the policy framework.},

This study examines the factors affecting non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners’ preferences for such forest management practices. A systematic literature review serves as a reference for the empirical analysis of a survey data on the Finnish NIPF owners’ stated willingness to adopt thirteen distinct forest management practices. Binary logit models reveal socio-demographic factors, site-specific characteristics, previous forest management, and motivations for forest ownership that are associated with the stated adoption of management practices. Especially, environmental and financial motivations play an important role in decisions concerning forest management practices. Statistically significant factors vary depending on the forest management practice, reflecting the NIPF owner heterogeneity. Younger and highly educated forest owners are more supportive for various management practices that promote biodiversity, while older forest owners are reluctant towards deadwood retention. The results underline the importance of accounting for heterogeneous preferences regarding forest management practices when designing and implementing policies and advisory services aiming at enhancing carbon sequestration, climate change adaptation, or biodiversity in boreal commercial forests.},

Sustainability through good advice is an important practice with limited effects, at least in the short run. Private regulations (certifications) have a relatively powerful influence on forest owners and complement the public informative policy instruments, implying that the forest sector can be depicted as private governance with government.},

The theory of critical mass states that when a committed minority reaches a critical size, a cascade of behavioural changes can occur, overturning apparently stable social norms. Evidence comes from theoretical and empirical studies in which minorities of very different sizes, including extremely small ones, manage to bring a system to its tipping point. Here, we explore this diversity of scenarios by introducing group interactions as a crucial element of realism into a model for social convention. We find that the critical mass necessary to trigger behaviour change can be very small if individuals have a limited propensity to change their views. Moreover, the ability of the committed minority to overturn existing norms depends in a complex way on the group size. Our findings reconcile the different sizes of critical mass found in previous investigations and unveil the critical role of groups in such a process. This further highlights the importance of the emerging field of higher-order networks, beyond pairwise interactions},

One of the streams of research in the field is inspired by Cash´s (2003) seminal work highlighting how the role of scientists depends on perceptions of salience, credibility and legitimacy. Other views call for attention to the politics involved in scientific performance while influencing policy and on the local circumstances, considering the many ways in which societies relate to science and expertise. The role of scientists in climate governance is a contested issue, relevant for many research centres aiming to influence policy decisions given the urgency of the climate crisis. To better understand this role, we reviewed mainstream international literature and identified four main approaches, which we label: scientific usable knowledge, politics of science, critical approaches and hybrid approaches. We contrasted the results with the experience of scientists from a Chilean climate research centre, to provide a view from the South on the role of scientists in climate governance. Our results show that Cash´s approach was a common ground for Chilean climate scientists, upon which they build ideas on the importance of building long-term relationships between scientists and policy makers. However, they also acknowledged the need to take into consideration the role of politics in climate-related decisions and the power relations and actor´s interests.},

Very much like new technologies and social innovation, institutional innovation emerges from the bottom up by non-state actors aiming to facilitate the governance of transformation. What is the potential of such institutional innovation?A sustainable economy fulfills societal needs in a fundamentally different way to the current economic system. Improvements to the efficiency of existing technologies or practices appear insufficient for achieving sustainable development within the planetary boundaries. Disruptive, systemic and transformational changes appear necessary in order to replace existing technologies and practices to establish a sustainable economy. Such innovations often start out in niches; however, the scaling up and the ultimate replacement of current socio-technical systems requires governance to allow for the coordination of actors, the reorganization of socio-technical systems and the mobilization and allocation of resources. As governmental institutions are part of the current (non-sustainable) systems and thereby fail to provide coherent, integrated and transformative governance, we explore whether institutional innovation from non-state actors can step in to provide governance of transformation processes. Based on explorative qualitative case studies of networks in the food sector, city planning and reporting tools, we analyze the potential of bottom-up institutional innovations to coordinate actors in transformation processes.},

It is commonly thought that very little has come out of this research in terms of commercially interesting technologies. The first objective of this paper is to demonstrate that this perception is no longer entirely correct; in the 1990s there has been a double-digit growth rate in the market for some renewable energy technologies. The consequent alteration in the energy system, is, however, a slow, painful and highly uncertain process. This process, we argue, needs to be studied using an innovation system perspective where the focus is on networks, institutions and firms’ perceptions, competencies and strategies. The second objective of the paper is therefore to present the bare bones of such an analytical framework. A third objective is to identify a set of key issues related to the speed and direction of that transformation process which needs to be studied further.},

This paper analyses the evolution of a biopower innovation system in Sweden where particular attention is given to current driving forces and obstacles to a large-scale diffusion of biopower. In the 1980s and 1990s, this innovation system went through a successful ‘formative phase’ in which all the constituent components of the ‘infant’ system emerged. With the introduction of green certificates and emission trading rights, incentives were created that were large enough to shift the system into a ‘growth phase’, where the extensive district heating system and voluminous production in the paper and pulp industry can be used to produce power on a large scale in CHP plants. An investment boom is now underway and output of biopower is rapidly growing. Yet, there are still substantial obstacles to a realisation of the full potential of biopower. Three of these are outlined and an associated set of policy challenges are specified.},

We demonstrate that an IS framework can identify a diverse set of system weaknesses in the field of environmental innovation and identify five venues for further research that can help strengthen the framework and improve its application to environmental innovations.},

What if the interviewee has a particularly strong agenda, far from the intended research topic? Are these ‘failed’ interviews? We address this issue using a ‘deviant’ interview in a study of ‘being a neighbour’. First, we add to the discussion of interviewees’ category representativeness by acknowledging a situation when the interviewee insists on representing a category not intended by the researcher. Second, we address the notion of asymmetries of power, where it is often assumed that the interviewer has the upper hand. Through this case, we argue that the opposite may well be true. Finally, we argue that cases where the interviewee pursues a strong agenda may suggest new research areas. After all, strong efforts of resistance may indicate deeper cultural concerns.},

Previous projections of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project’s Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 identified substantial climate impacts on all major crops, but associated uncertainties were substantial. Here we report new twenty-first-century projections using ensembles of latest-generation crop and climate models. Results suggest markedly more pessimistic yield responses for maize, soybean and rice compared to the original ensemble. Mean end-of-century maize productivity is shifted from +5\% to −6\% (SSP126) and from +1\% to −24\% (SSP585)—explained by warmer climate projections and improved crop model sensitivities. In contrast, wheat shows stronger gains (+9\% shifted to +18\%, SSP585), linked to higher CO2 concentrations and expanded high-latitude gains. The ‘emergence’ of climate impacts consistently occurs earlier in the new projections—before 2040 for several main producing regions. While future yield estimates remain uncertain, these results suggest that major breadbasket regions will face distinct anthropogenic climatic risks sooner than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {Understanding the contribution of forests to poverty alleviation and human well-being has never been more important. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are erasing gains in poverty reduction achieved over the past several decades. At the same time, climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, especially in poor rural communities. In this paper, we review approaches to measuring poverty and well-being finding that standard approaches to measuring poverty and poverty dynamics typically do not adequately consider environmental goods and services, leading to an incompelete understanding of poverty dynamics among policy makers and practitioners. We identify four archetypal poverty trajectories and discuss how subsistence and cash income, assets, and non-material benefits from forests and tree-based systems influence each of them. We draw on the broad literature on forests and livelihoods, acknowledging that the majority of the literature on the topic of forests and poverty relies on static, micro-level, and highly contextualized analyses. Our review suggest that forests and tree-based systems provide a pathway out of poverty only under very specific conditions, when high value goods are accessible and marketed, or when ecosystem services can be monetized for the benefit of people living in or near forests. However, the role that forests play in supporting and maintaining current consumption, diversifying incomes, and meeting basic needs may be extremely important, particularly for those experiencing transient poverty. We discuss negative externalities associated with living proximate to forests, including the special case of geographic poverty traps, which can occur in remote forested areas. To build a strong evidence base for policy makers we recommend that research on forest-poverty dynamics address longer time-frames (up to decades), larger and/or nested spatial scales, and are contextualized within the landscape, region, or national setting where it is conducted. Advancing our understanding of forest-poverty dynamics is critical, particularly in low and middle-income countries where large numbers of people live in or near forests or in landscapes with forest-agriculture mosaics. Policy makers should strive to understand the potential role for forest-based livelihood strategies among their suite of social protection and poverty reduction policies and programs, particularly for addressing transient poverty.},

  abstract = {Monitoring schemes and indicators are currently under development to enable the assessment of the economic, social, political, and environmental impacts of bioeconomic transitions and better inform bioeconomic policy-making. Such transitions generally mean reduction in fossil resource use through innovative, clean technologies that can enable substitution of biogenic resources for fossil resources. The concept of bioeconomy transition is not yet well embedded in current monitoring schemes. Proper framing and a quantitative indicator for measuring the advancement and status of bioeconomy transitions has been missing up to now. This research aims to lay some groundwork for monitoring transitions from fossil-based to bio-based economies by adapting an existing bioeconomic framework and applying a newly developed indicator: the Substitution Share Indicator (SSI). This indicator relates bio-based substitute products to their fossil-based counterparts and accounts for indirect fossil resource flows, which are estimated using a bottom-up approach, based on life-cycle inventory data, and a top-down approach, based on input–output data. The innovative indicator is tested and validated for the first time in the case of transport fuels and plastics sector in Germany. The SSI in the German transport fuels sector is currently relatively low, at 3.1\% (bottom-up approach) to 3.4\% (top-down approach). It is even lower in the plastics sector, at 0.09\% (bottom-up approach) to 0.6\% (top-down approach). Major policy efforts need to be undertaken in Germany, focused not only on the growing bioeconomy but on substitution effects as well. Future policies should provide incentives for increasing production of innovative bio-based substitute goods, improving the fossil resource use efficiency of existing fossil- and bio-based products, and lowering consumption of fossil-based products. Such efforts should be reflected in the SSI and signal bioeconomy transition. Before the widespread use of the indicator for policy formulation and analysis, further advancement is recommended. A hybrid approach integrating process data into input–output data would be expedient for improving the SSI in terms of credibility, measurability and robustness. Linkage to relevant indicators for sustainability assessment of transitions is equally important for effectively monitoring sustainable bioeconomy transitions.},

We propose a starting point for monitoring bioeconomy transitions by suggesting an adapted framework, relevant sectors, and indicators that can be observed with existing information and data from many alternative sources, assuming that official data collection methods will not be modified soon. Economic–environmental indicators and innovation indicators are derived for the German surfactant industry based on the premise that combined economic–environmental indicators can show actual developments and trade-offs, while innovation indicators can reveal whether a bioeconomy transition is likely in a sector. Methodological challenges are discussed and low-cost; high-benefit options for further data collection are recommended.},

The total number of papers matching the keywords was 161. We found that the number of papers published on the topic is increasing and that, on average, each paper was cited 18 times. A total of 504 authors dealt with the topic, presenting a rather small community. This finding was reinforced by the outcomes of the analysis of regions where the authors of the papers were affiliated—Europe being the region to which most papers were affiliated. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the literature on forest bioeconomy innovations. We found that authors dealt with the necessary adaptation of policies, while innovations were mainly focused on biorefining, biotechnology, production of various biomaterials, as well as innovations of business models and stakeholder interactions.},

A number of studies have presented the notion of the ‘echo chamber’ to model and explain information flows across an array of social settings, finding disproportionate connections among ideologically similar political communicators. This paper builds on these findings to provide a more formal operationalization of the components of echo chambers. We then empirically test their utility using survey data collected from the community of political elites engaged in the contentious issue of climate politics in the United States. Our survey period coincides with the most active and contentious period in the history of US climate policy, when legislation regulating carbon dioxide emissions had passed through the House of Representatives and was being considered in the Senate. We use exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to demonstrate that both the homogeneity of information (the echo) and multi-path information transmission (the chamber) play significant roles in policy communication. We demonstrate that the intersection of these components creates echo chambers in the climate policy network. These results lead to some important conclusions about climate politics, as well as the relationship between science communication and policymaking at the elite level more generally.},

Using patents granted by USPTO from 1976 to 2020, we evaluate the "intellectual distance" between clean and dirty technologies. Our measure of intellectual distance is intuitively similar to "degrees of separation" where 1 indicates that a clean patent directly cites a prior dirty patent, and 2 indicates that there is an intermediary technology. We find that less than one-tenth of clean patents directly cite prior dirty art. Since citations are a proxy for learning, this implies that for the most part, leveraging dirty knowledge to pivot into clean sectors is not straightforward. However, there is a high degree of heterogeneity. Some clean technologies such as geothermal energy, carbon capture and storage, and offshore wind learn significantly from dirty technologies, due to shared knowhow related to drilling, pollution-control and operating out at sea. Our analysis identifies "clean adjacent sectors" that build upon dirty knowledge inputs, which could be plausible diversification options for dirty firms.},

The challenge includes the complex interconnectedness relations in actors, artefacts and institutions and the lack of comprehensive datasets.

Then, we pick up the eHealth innovations as the investigation topic. The investigated elements include technology, actor and institution (standard). As a result, our analytical results reflect major historical events and results of prior studies, e.g., standard records. Next, we find that the observation of interconnectedness in technology and institution is accessible by the focal actors, especially the bridge role in the network. Then, we further confirm that the focal actors and their standardization behaviours are the main body to shape the transition activities. Thirdly, to observe the transition process, we assess the proposed framework by the core characteristics of the transition. Last, we differentiate two perspectives, technological trajectory and focal actor, on the standard investigation, which paves another way to investigate standards in innovation studies.

Appropriate indicators are needed to help policy makers set accurate targets for the carbon balance of their foreign trade and monitor the development of trade in a meaningful way. This paper proposes a new displacement indicator – the technology adjusted balance of emissions embodied in trade – that improves on existing ideas by separating out the effects of scale and composition of trade from the effects of different technologies and energy systems. The new indicator is calculated for Swedish and UK trade from 1995 to 2009, a period when both countries have reported decreasing territorial emissions together with sustained economic growth. One key finding is that, for both countries, outsourcing of emissions is less serious than what conventional analysis of emissions embodied in trade suggests. For Sweden, the technology adjusted balance of emissions embodied in trade is positive throughout the studied period, implying that its exports reduce emissions abroad more than what is generated by its imports. However, we also find that both countries have changed the composition of their imports and exports during this period: imports have become more carbon intensive and, exports less so, compared to the world economy at large.},

However, NFPs do not always reconcile conflicting perspectives or produce legitimate strategies for sustainable forestry. Thus, further analysis of NFPs' organization and processes is required, including exploration of effective means to address such challenges in early stages. These are key concerns of this paper, focusing on the first process to establish a Swedish NFP. Possibilities for an NFP to constitute a new arena for deliberation and consensus-building, producing forest policy statements and action plans considered legitimate by various stakeholders, are discussed. A number of key challenges are identified through a theoretical framework based on notions regarding the input and output legitimacy of collaborative governance. Analysis of official documentation, records of public hearings and stakeholder comments from the establishment phase in 2013–2015 suggests that the process will continually face a number of challenges, including balancing production and conservation values in the new bio-economy and securing equal stakeholder participation. The paper concludes with some remarks on the future of the NFP process.},

  abstract = {The extensive outsourcing of forest harvesting operations means that the operational performance of contractors has an immense impact on the forest industry supply chain. This study describes perceived drivers and obstacles for strong performance in harvesting service based on semi-structured interviews with four production supervisors and eight contractors. The analysis of interview data revealed a wide array of factors considered to drive or hinder the performance. The factors were categorized into five types: Capability, Incentives, Commitment, Involvement and External factors. Factors concerning Capability, especially resources and competence, were most frequently considered by production supervisors as both drivers and hinders. The contractors considered most commonly Incentives to affect performance, especially motivation and strategy, as drivers and the economy as hinder. Both parties considered lack of resources as hinder to performance. For competence, relationship and collaboration interface, on the other hand, the two parties had different views on whether they acted as drivers or hinders. The knowledge presented in this paper is of interest to researchers or practitioners who wishes to understand the complexities underlying successful harvesting service performance. The insights can contribute to the reshaping of business practices to better target and leverage the mechanisms that most strongly affect performance.},

  abstract = {This paper argues for subsuming the question of open data within a larger question of information justice, with the immediate aim being to establish the need for rather than the principles of such a theory. I show that there are several problems of justice that emerge as a consequence of opening data to full public accessibility, and are generally a consequence of the failure of the open data movement to understand the constructed nature of data. I examine three such problems: the embedding of social privilege in datasets as the data is constructed, the differential capabilities of data users (especially differences between citizens and “enterprise” users), and the norms that data systems impose through their function as disciplinary systems. In each case I show that open data has the quite real potential to exacerbate rather than alleviate injustices. This necessitates a theory of information justice. I briefly suggest two complementary directions in which such a theory might be developed: one defining a set of moral inquiries that can be used to evaluate the justness of data practices, and another exploring the practices and structures that a social movement promoting information justice might pursue.},

Yet attention towards the role of the state is underdeveloped in the field. The significance of this neglect has become more apparent in particular due to the heightened urgency around the need to tackle climate change and energy security, where there are increasing calls for an enhanced role for the state. This paper sets out to advance understandings of the multiple and conflicting roles that states play in transitions. It first addresses key weaknesses in the way the state has been examined thus far. Second, it highlights theoretical resources and conceptualisations of the state that can help scholars of transitions open up new and more productive avenues for understanding drivers and barriers to sustainable transitions drawing on examples from different sectors, regions and issue areas.},

To gain a more comprehensive view of forest restoration, this paper compares the US forest restoration debate of the 1940s and 1990s, in the disciplines of ecology and forestry. The paper focuses on historical approaches to pasts and futures, and on “sociotechnical imaginaries” providing societal legitimacy to restoration ventures. Historical scientific papers constitute the paper’s empirical sources. The analysis shows that, among ecologists and foresters, forest restoration of the 1940s was oriented towards efficiency and challenges such as wood demands during World War II, whereas restoration of the 1990s was oriented towards conservation and environmental challenges. The approaches of the 1940s′ ecologists and foresters seem motivated by a sociotechnical imaginary connecting forest restoration to societal progress, whereas the approaches of their 1990s′ counterparts seem motivated by a sociotechnical imaginary connecting forest restoration to the task of mitigating society’s impacts. Based on the conclusions, it is argued that future research on forest restoration would benefit from comparing the idealized pasts of both yield- and conservation-oriented conceptions of forest restoration.},

Following abrupt land change, local biodiversity often continues to be influenced through biotic lag effects. However, current understanding of how terrestrial biodiversity is impacted by past abrupt land changes is incomplete. Here we show that abrupt land change in the past continues to influence present species assemblages globally. We combine geographically and taxonomically broad data on local biodiversity with quantitative estimates of abrupt land change detected within time series of satellite imagery from 1982 to 2015. Species richness and abundance were 4.2\% and 2\% lower, respectively, and assemblage composition was altered at sites with an abrupt land change compared to unchanged sites, although impacts differed among taxonomic groups. Biodiversity recovered to levels comparable to unchanged sites after {$>$}10 years. Ignoring delayed impacts of abrupt land changes likely results in incomplete assessments of biodiversity change.},

  abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the discussion on the relation between thermodynamics and economic theory. With respect to thermodynamic constraints on the economy, there are two diametrically opposite positions in this discussion. One claims that the constraints are insignificant (‘of no immediate practical importance for modelling’) and in the intermediate run, do not limit economic activity and, therefore, need not be incorporated in the economic theory. The other holds that thermodynamics tells us that there are practical limits to materials recycling, which already puts bounds on the economy and, therefore, must be included in the economic models. Using the thermodynamic concept of entropy, we show here that there are fundamental problems with both positions. Even in the long run, entropy production associated with material dissipation need not be a limiting factor for economic development. Abundant energy resources from solar radiation may be used to recover dissipated elements. With simple, quantitative analysis we show that the rate of entropy production caused by human economic activities is very small compared to the continuous natural entropy production in the atmosphere and on the Earth’s surface. Further, the societal entropy production is well within the range of natural variation. It is possible to replace part of the natural entropy production with societal entropy production by making use of solar energy. Society consumes resources otherwise available for coming generations. However, future generations need not have less resources available to them than the present generation. Human industrial activities could be transformed into a sustainable system where the more abundant elements are industrially used and recycled, using solar energy as the driving resource. An economic theory, fit to guide industrial society in that development, must not disregard thermodynamics nor must it overstate the consequences of the laws of thermodynamics. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

By comparison to other forms of electric power generation, offshore wind energy is generally considered to have relatively benign effects on the marine environment. However, offshore projects include platforms, turbines, cables, substations, grids, interconnection and shipping, dredging and associated construction activity. The Operation \& Maintenance (O\&M) activities include the transport of employees by vessel or helicopter and occasional hardware retrofits. Therefore, various impacts are incurred in the construction, operation and decommissioning phases; mainly the underwater noise and the impacts on the fauna. Based on the fact that in many of the aforementioned issues there are still serious environmental uncertainties, contradictive views and emerging research, the present work intents to provide a thorough literature review on the environmental and social impacts of offshore wind energy projects in comparison with the onshore counterparts.},

Beyond simply shaping what people do, we argue that norms constrain what behaviors even come to mind as options, effectively excluding counternormative behaviors from consideration. We test this hypothesis across five primary and multiple supplementary studies using diverse methods (Ntotal=5488). In Study 1, people reported that behaviors that were counternormative in a situation, even behaviors that could satisfy a motivational drive, were far less likely to come to mind and less desirable than behaviors that were norm-consistent. Going beyond self-report measures, Studies 2A-2C found that people even misrepresented norm-violating behaviors as “impossible,” suggesting they are not considered. Using a change-blindness paradigm, Study 3 found that people were less likely to track changes in goal-relevant objects that would be counternormative (vs. normative) to engage with. Studies 4 and 5 explored implications for problems of temptation and self-control. Study 4 found that members of a clinical population striving to eat healthier reported that the very same unhealthy but tasty food items would be less tempting and would trigger less self-control conflict if they encountered the food in a context where its consumption would be counternormative (vs. normative). Study 5, a field study, shows that introducing a norm prohibiting laptop use in class reduced students’ temptation to multitask (as well as actual multitasking) over the term, whereas encouraging individual self-control did not. Discussion addresses how norms can be harnessed to lighten burdens of temptations and help people achieve their goals.},

  abstract = {Eco-innovation is an approach to environmental sustainability. However, the process of eco-innovation can be challenging especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus, SMEs might seek external support to tackle some of their challenges in eco-innovation. In this article, we focus on one type of organization providing and also assisting SMEs to access support, intermediaries, i.e. an organization or body that acts as an agent or broker in the innovation process. Intermediaries support firms in the innovation process through various generic and customised activities. To identify such activities and describe the roles intermediaries take in eco-innovation, we conducted interviews and documentation analysis on selected intermediaries in two regions – Scania, Sweden and North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. The identified roles among our cases include: (i) forecasting and road mapping, (ii) information gathering and dissemination, (iii) fostering networking and partnerships, (iv) prototyping and piloting, (v) technical consulting, (vi) resource mobilisation, (vii) commercialisation, and (viii) branding and legitimation. In relation to the specific characteristics of eco-innovations, the intermediary roles such as prototyping and piloting, information gathering and dissemination, and branding were directly targeted at validating the environmental benefits of eco-innovations to tackle their “double externality” challenge. However, we found little intermediation activities from our cases directed explicitly at policy change for eco-innovation. For policy makers, our results suggest a complementary use of different types of intermediaries to support eco-innovation.},

  abstract = {This article examines the evolution of energy use and pollution emissions in Sweden over the past two centuries—a much longer period than has been investigated in the large literature on the environmental Kuznets curve. In this article we show that both energy consumption and pollution emissions in Sweden declined relative to GDP over the last two hundred years. In absolute terms both energy use and pollution increased up until 1970, after which date energy consumption stabilised and pollutant emissions declined, leading to less environmental stress. The energy intensity results are decomposed to determine the relative impact of structural changes in the output structure versus within-sector changes. For the period after 1970 another decomposition for pollution emissions is performed to separate out changes in preferences from energy-related changes. The analyses show that technical change in a broad sense has been crucial for explaining the long-term decline in both energy intensity and pollutant intensity, while the transition to the service economy had negligible effects. Changed preferences affected the decline in emissions after 1970.},

This challenge is linked to the dynamics of the First Deep Transition (Schot, 2016): the creation and expansion of a wide range of socio-technical systems in a similar direction over the past 200–250\,years. Extending the theoretical framework of Schot and Kanger (2018), this paper proposes that the First Deep Transition has been built up through successive Great Surges of Development (Perez, 2002), leading to the emergence of a macro-level selection environment called industrial modernity. This has resulted in the formation of a portfolio of directionality, characterized by dominant and durable directions and occasional discontinuous shifts in addition to a continuous variety of alternatives sustained in niches or single systems. This historically-informed view on the co-evolution of single socio-technical systems, complexes of systems and industrial modernity has distinctive implications for policy-making targeted at resolving the current challenges.},

  abstract = {Recent literature has turned considerable attention to the role of policy mixes in shaping socio-technical systems towards sustainability. However, the identification of relevant policy intervention points has remained a relatively neglected topic. This is a potentially significant oversight given that such intervention points constitute a mid-step between means (particular policy instruments) and overall goals (change in the directionality of socio-technical systems). By complementing existing work on policy mixes with additional insights from transitions literature, this paper formulates a conceptual framework of six policy intervention points for transformative systems change. The coding scheme developed on the basis of this framework is used to review current literature on policy mixes in sustainability transitions. It is shown that the latter has so far primarily focused on niche-regime dynamics while largely neglecting the broader context of these interactions. We argue that adopting a wider perspective on intervention points can aid future work on policy mixes by enabling the identification of root causes and critical problems of ongoing transitions, and to spot gaps in existing policy activities. The case of the Estonian energy system is used to briefly illustrate these possibilities. Methodologically, we demonstrate the value of combining theory-based concept-formation with a systematic literature review, enabling not only a provision of a summary of existing literature but also highlighting systematic gaps in that literature.},

We model the development of the intra-distribution of the indicators using Markov transition matrices. We find that the ten circular bioeconomies mostly progressed. Moreover, research and development quickly progressed in the private sector but regressed in the public sector, suggesting substitution between them. Our cross-country comparison reveals that Germany is the front-runner in the circular bioeconomy, but circular bioeconomies in Slovakia, Poland, and Latvia also developed quickly.},

The articles were divided on the basis of study area, the sector of industries had more than one industry and the largest share was of manufacturing industries. In the Section of research method, the mathematical modeling has had the most use in the articles reviewed. The results of the study showed that the Journal of Cleaner Production, Business Strategy and the Environment had the highest number of publications on GI. Clustering of articles was done using the Cite space tool and the articles were cited using the CiteNetexplor tool and the density mapping of the co-authoring network of researchers was done by using VOS viewer software. In addition, some future research opportunities were suggested and discussed in this article.

  abstract = {Analytic induction (AI) is a research logic used to guide data collection, develop analysis, and organize the presentation of research findings. The strategy of AI is exclusively qualitative, seeking encounters with new varieties of data in order to force revisions that will make the analysis valid when applied to an increasingly diverse range of cases. Originally understood as an alternative to statistical sampling methodologies, AI continues primarily as a way to develop explanations of the interactional processes through which people develop what, in their experiences, are homogenous forms of distinctive social action. AI transforms and produces a sociological appreciation of phenomena along recurrent lines. The target phenomenon is progressively redefined to address a process; explanatory conditions are redefined to specify the interactions through which people, by learning, recognizing, or becoming aware of features of their biographies and circumstances, in effect set up the motivational dynamics of their own conduct. The methodology of AI thus dovetails with the theoretical perspective of symbolic interaction and produces a phenomenologically grounded sociology. AI also dovetails with ethnography's narrative style. One frequently cited weakness is that AI specifies only necessary but not sufficient conditions. Another is that it produces tautological explanations. The methodology does, however, support what might be called `retrodiction': predictions, made at time 3, that if a given behavior is observed to have occurred at time 2, specific phenomena must have come into existence at time 1. Although rarely touted as `policy research,' the upshot of an AI study is a documented portrayal of some segment of social life that is systematically misrepresented by the culture that supports power. AI's quest for systematic knowledge is no less secure than is the understanding that social life takes shape as people crystallize long-evolved perspectives, familiar behavioral techniques, and cultured interpersonal sensibilities into patterns of situationally responsive conduct and distinctive qualities of lived experience.},

It does so by drawing attention to socio-economic developments neglected in the Deep Transition (DT) framework of Kanger and Schot, such as marketization, labour contracts becoming more individual and precarious, and changing human beliefs, aspirations, needs and wants as important developments. The framework of Deep Transition is criticised for neglecting tensions and contestations about progress, the socio-economic order and distributional issues. This paper aims to complement ‘deep transitions’ research with insights about socio-economic transformation processes. These are shown to be conflict-ridden and full of tensions, creating pressures on socio-economic orders and institutional logics. Because of this, development does not follow a neat pattern of convergence. In addition to identifying neglected issues and conceptual blind spots, the paper also outlines the scope for conceptual bridging between socio-technical and socio-economic transformation perspectives through attention to institutional logics and dialectics of change. We make a plea for a broader DT research agenda that covers relevant socio-economic rules, meta-regimes and institutional contradictions. Attention to directionality helps to deal with three weaknesses of the DT framework: the assumption of convergence, materialism, and insufficient attention to the multitude of value orientations and logics.},

With economic growth becoming ever more difficult and undesirable, and sustainability challenges ever more pressing, alternative post-growth and Degrowth discourses have gained momentum in the last decade. However, the role of technology on the path towards a ‘Degrowth Society’ is far from clear and subject to intense debate between enthusiasts and sceptics of technology. This editorial to the special issue on ‘Degrowth and Technology’ represents the first in-depth analysis of the multiple perspectives on technology present in the Degrowth community. Using an artistic analogy, we illustrate four main areas of exploration for a future Degrowth and Technology research agenda: 1) theoretical and conceptual approaches, 2) case studies of innovative socio-technical arrangements, 3) evaluation of technologies according to their feasibility, viability, appropriateness and conviviality and 4) governance approaches. Moreover, we identify and discuss reoccurring themes in the texts such as energy, agency and democratisation of technology and introduce new concepts such as ‘Degrowth Technology’ and 'Degrowth Society’. Finally, we offer guidance for future research and for the development of a shared socio-technological imaginary of the Degrowth community.},

The terms ‘global’ or its much-used counterpart ‘international’ imply a world outside rich nations (often seen as the epicentre of everything progressive and ‘good’); a world which needs development or health assistance. The fact that these implicit connotations are largely unchallenged in most global health and global development institutions in HICs itself is worrisome and illustrates how both these sectors continue to be steeped in white supremacy and saviorism.2 Even terms originally coined without a connotation of hierarchy, such as global North versus global South (or West vs East), end up implying hierarchies given these divisions are based on access to wealth and political power. The temptation to categorise and dichotomise is very powerful and pervasive. All of us have used some of these terms at some point in our professions and activities. Some terms such as the now defunct ‘First World vs Third World’ imply racism in terms of hierarchy; the notion that some are first and others behind.5 Most people today avoid them, but Western media for instance, continue to use them every now and then, as we have seen most …},

  abstract = {In the face of growing demand for sustainable sources of biomass, the challenge of mobilising non-industrial private forest landowners (NIPF) with varying management objectives, to actively manage their forests and increase the supply of wood biomass, is an area of growing research and policy focus. While innovation and knowledge exchange is increasingly viewed as a means of promoting sustainable wood mobilisation, structural weaknesses in the sector such as deficiencies in the institutional and infrastructural setting or capacity of stakeholders, can negatively influence innovation processes. Addressing these overarching challenges requires a systemic analysis of the barriers to innovation across the forest sector as a whole. This case study of the Irish forest sector develops a comprehensive innovation systems framework, integrating structural and functional streams of innovation systems research. This `coupled structural–functional’ framework is applied to identify a number of interconnected systemic problems that hinder the functioning of the forest sector innovation system and negatively influence the potential for co-innovation and wood mobilisation in the sector. Three sets of key systemic wood mobilisation problems are identified, among which there is negative feedback. These so called `blocking mechanisms' have developed over time as a result of historical patterns of practice, prevailing culture, attitude and regulation and are defined here as (i) weak networks blocking capacity development of new forest owners, (ii) infrastructural problems blocking the reach and effectiveness of knowledge networks, (iii) rigid institutional structures and policy blocking co-innovation. To address these deficiencies in the current forest policy and institutional environment, this study makes a number of policy recommendations to promote co-innovation and tackle the multi-dimensional challenge of wood mobilisation.},

  abstract = {Pureora Forest Park is one of the largest remaining and most ecologically and culturally significant areas of the native forest that once clothed almost all the North Island of New Zealand. Systematic logging and the establishment of sawmilling villages began in the Pureora area in the late 1940s. Concern about the effects of logging of virgin forest on native fauna accelerated until 1978, when a widely publicised tree-sitting protest led to a forced moratorium. The settlement that followed stopped the logging, closed the sawmills, and caused mass local unemployment and social conflict. The long-term solution required an integrated approach, reconciling the needs of economic resource utilisation with those of social welfare and biodiversity conservation. This paper describes the processes leading up to the unprecedented financial settlement that saved the forest, plus the details of the compensation package paid to timber companies for broken contracts, and the consequent benefits for conservation and tourism.},

However, traditional indicators from patents and questionnaire-based surveys often lack coverage, granularity as well as timeliness and may involve high data collection costs, especially when conducted at a large scale. Consequently, they struggle to provide policy makers and scientists with the full picture of the current state of the innovation system. In this paper, we propose a first approach on generating web-based innovation indicators which may have the potential to overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional indicators. Specifically, we develop a method to identify product innovator firms at a large scale and very low costs. We use traditional firm-level indicators from a questionnaire-based innovation survey (German Community Innovation Survey) to train an artificial neural network classification model on labelled (product innovator/no product innovator) web texts of surveyed firms. Subsequently, we apply this classification model to the web texts of hundreds of thousands of firms in Germany to predict whether they are product innovators or not. We then compare these predictions to firm-level patent statistics, survey extrapolation benchmark data, and regional innovation indicators. The results show that our approach produces reliable predictions and has the potential to be a valuable and highly cost-efficient addition to the existing set of innovation indicators, especially due to its coverage and regional granularity.},

A typology of “scholarly bullshit” is proposed which includes the following archetypes: boring question scholarship, literature review of literature reviews, recycled research, master thesis madness, and activist rants. Since “scholarly bullshit” articles engage with the latest academic buzzwords, they also tend to accumulate significant citations and are thus welcomed by many journal editors. Citations matter most in the metric-driven logic of the academic system, and this type of scholarship, sadly, is thus unlikely to decrease in the coming years.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest in policy mixes in innovation studies. While it has long been acknowledged that the stimulation of innovation and technological change involves different types of policy instruments, how such instruments form policy mixes has only recently become of interest. We argue that an area in which policy mixes are particularly important is the field of sustainability transitions. Transitions imply not only the development of disruptive innovations but also of policies aiming for wider change in socio-technical systems. We propose that ideally policy mixes for transitions include elements of ‘creative destruction’, involving both policies aiming for the ‘creation’ of new and for ‘destabilising’ the old. We develop a novel analytical framework including the two policy mix dimensions (‘creation’ and ‘destruction’) by broadening the technological innovation system functions approach, and specifically by expanding the concept of ‘motors of innovation’ to ‘motors of creative destruction’. We test this framework by analysing ‘low energy’ policy mixes in Finland and the UK. We find that both countries have diverse policy mixes to support energy efficiency and reduce energy demand with instruments to cover all functions on the creation side. Despite the demonstrated need for such policies, unsurprisingly, destabilising functions are addressed by fewer policies, but there are empirical examples of such policies in both countries. The concept of ‘motors of creative destruction’ is introduced to expand innovation and technology policy debates to go beyond policy mixes consisting of technology push and demand pull instruments, and to consider a wider range of policy instruments combined in a suitable mix which may contribute to sustainability transitions.},

In this paper, energy cooperation between an integrated Swedish pulp and paper mill and two nearby energy companies was analysed through economic optimisations. The synergies of cooperation were evaluated through optimisations with different system perspectives. Three changes of the energy system and combinations of them were analysed. The changes were process integration, extending biofuel boiler and turbine capacity and connection to a local heat market. The results show that the single most promising system change is extending biofuel and turbine capacity. Process integration within the pulp and paper mill would take place through installing evaporation units that yield less excess heat but must in this particular case be combined with extended biofuel combustion capacity in order to be beneficial. Connecting to the local heat market would be beneficial for the pulp and paper mill, while the studied energy company needs to extend its biofuel capacity in order to benefit from the local heat market. Furthermore, the potential of reducing CO2 emissions through the energy cooperation is shown to be extensive; particularly if biofuel and turbine capacity is increased.},

Within the literature, these labels are frequently used interchangeably due to overlaps in their characteristics. These various definitions present challenges when the labels are operationalized in empirical studies. Based on a quantitative analysis of the most common innovation labels’ definitions in 532 scientific papers, we find that novelty and impact, predominantly used for empirical operationalization, differentiate only between ordinary and more exceptional innovations. Based on our findings, a differentiation between the impact’s target and the consideration of positive versus negative effects enables better distinction between labels for more ‘exceptional’ innovations. We extend the existing literature and enable a more precise definition of (single) innovations by providing a novel, more nuanced description of innovations’ different characteristics and a further distinction of their effects. Thereby, the relevant decisive aspects will be communicated more accurately.},

  abstract = {Research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications, and deepened with respect to theories and methods. This article provides an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field, classified into nine main themes: understanding transitions; power, agency and politics; governing transitions; civil society, culture and social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and methodologies. The review shows that the scope of sustainability transitions research has broadened and connections to established disciplines have grown stronger. At the same time, we see that the grand challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. Transition studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives, approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the direction of sustainability.},

It applies the Multi-Level Perspective on transitions, combining case studies of mobility niches in the Netherlands with simulations of transitions pathways using the MATISSE model, by applying the bridging approach proposed by Turnheim et al. (2015a). The iterative, combined qualitative case study and quantitative simulation approach develops transition pathways including both behavioural and technological change. The results show that both technological substitution to low carbon cars or a reconfiguration pathway away from car ownership to mobility lifestyles based on new public transport or cycling and walking for local trips are possible. However, while there is empirical evidence for the initial stage of a technological substitution to battery electric vehicles, transitions away from car ownership as the dominant mobility lifestyle have to overcome an established regime and will require major changes in culture and behaviour as well as support for new priorities in the institutions of transport planning.},

It has provided valuable heuristics to guide policy; but it has also led to the recognition of major challenges in the management of uncertainty and complexity. In this paper, we address these challenges by linking transformative innovation policy with research perspectives from (i) complex adaptive systems, (ii) ecosystems, and (iii) adaptive and participatory governance. Specifically, we develop a conceptual framework for transformative governance, which seeks to improve the adaptiveness and resilience of the ecosystem and orchestrates socio-technical transformation based on the balanced presence of~diversity, connectivity, polycentricity, redundancy and directionality. We also present an illustrative example by applying the framework to a Finnish policy reform in which the lack of balanced attention to the ecosystem features catalysed major shortcomings in an emerging innovation mobility ecosystem. Finally, we explore the implications for the design of individual policies and policy mixes which arise from the recognition of complexity and the holistic policy impacts on the ecosystem and society at large.},

Based on data from a national online survey, we performed a quantitative social network analysis to investigate emerging social structures and policy beliefs in the context of the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy. Our explorative analysis shows that research, governmental, and industrial organizations mainly constitute the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy network. Actors primarily exchange information, and most key organizations report high levels of trust among each other. However, the network structure is rather closed. This raises concerns about equal benefit sharing and the inclusiveness of concerned actors. We discuss the implication of this network structure for enabling new innovations. Finally, we present the key aspects and drivers of business as usual, and suggest an option for or a more transformative change in the Finnish forest-based bioeconomy.},

We use the fiber-based packaging sector to assess the understanding and perception concerning the definition of bioeconomy and its' future pathways. This is accomplished through a qualitative analysis of 14 thematic interviews conducted with actor network members in Finland. Regarding the concept of bioeconomy, their opinions differ broadly, ranging from seeing the concept as a Trojan horse, i.e. a new term for driving old political agendas, to a totally new way of organizing a sustainable future. We identified two alternative bioeconomy visions, of which the socio-ecological one is highlighted slightly more frequently, embedding the implementation of a circular economy and aiming at decoupling resource use from the economic benefits. Additionally, few interviewees considered the technological development pathway with increased resource efficiency to be a more likely outcome for the fiber-based packaging business. However, the simultaneous development of these two paths is envisaged most frequently, indicating that both social and technological innovations are mutually needed to create more sustainable packaging production and consumption patterns. We identified three characteristics of sustainable packaging: compatibility with the circular production-consumption system, satisfying heterogeneous consumer needs, and supporting sustainable lifestyles by extended material life cycles.},

We develop such a framework, discuss its relevance for various types of countries and examine which policies different countries have employed to promote renewable energy. We compare the strategies of Germany, with more focus on market instruments, of California, with a greater emphasis of R\&D, and of China, characterized by central planning. In addition, we interpret the results of decomposition analyses using two factor learning curves. We draw conclusions about a desirable balance of subsidies and associated policies.},

Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production.},

Different innovation perspectives are essential for achieving and understanding transitions. They range from actor-oriented (organizational innovation management, regional innovation ecosystems) to mode-oriented (responsible innovation, mission-driven innovation) to process-oriented (social innovation) perspectives. For sustainability transitions to be governed, we need a better understanding of how the relevant contributions of innovations can be measured. In this article, we review the status of measurement across the different innovation perspectives. We find that measurement status becomes weaker as we move from actor-oriented to process-oriented innovations. To address this shortcoming, we then develop a conceptual approach for measuring social innovation. Thereby, we integrate organizational innovation capacities and regional contexts with the transformational elements of social innovation. We discuss how such an integrated and multi-level approach to measurement enhances our understanding of social innovations and, in particular, their contributions to sustainability transitions. We contribute to the sustainability transitions literature by tying it to different innovation perspectives and by conceptualizing new innovation mechanisms that drive transformations. We add to social innovation theory by specifying its role in change toward sustainability and advancing it to a measurable construct relevant to governance and policymaking.},

They are subject to constant change and increasing demands with respect to the ecosystem services they provide. As well as provision of timber, non-timber forest goods (e.g. berries and mushrooms), clean water, carbon sequestration, and protection against natural disasters, there is increasing emphasis being placed on conservation and promotion of biodiversity within forests. However, the state of biodiversity in European forests varies widely. Because of the different biogeographic, sociocultural, political, and climatic conditions at small scales, there is a wide variety of situations, approaches, and legacies across the continent.This book strives to show the challenges that forest managers are faced with to fulfil the societal demands with regard to forests, and especially to integrate the promotion of biodiversity. In a first section (12 chapters), 44 authors from science, policy, and practice describe the driving factors of forest management; these factors include national laws and legacies, ownership structures, forest history, and socio-structural conditions. In a second section, 113 authors present 32 case examples from 19 European countries that demonstrate the different approaches to integrate the locally requested ecosystem services. These experiences are synthesised in a final section, and a toolbox of integrative measures is presented that is intended to support forest owners and managers to choose appropriate measures for targeted integrated management in their forests.Copyright reserved WSL and EFI.},

While there are several factors that explain why climate adaptation has not been the subject of sustainable transitions research historically, the process of adapting to climate impacts is well-suited to the analytical frameworks developed in transitions studies. Key areas where sustainable transitions research could contribute to adaptation include: the normative and directed nature of adaptation, cross-scalar politics associated with transformation, and the role of the private sector in adaptation. Similarly, adaptation research can inform the understanding of the role of disturbance and disasters in transitions, and increase attention to vulnerabilities, inequality and uneven impacts of transitions. Synergies between mitigation and adaptation, insights into the relationship between transitions and transformation, and just transitions are likely to be productive areas for collaborative engagement.},

  abstract = {This exploratory study proposes an original methodology to operationalize and signal SMEs’ engagement in challenging dimensions of implementing Open Innovation. We verify whether the European SME Instrument is achieving its goal of providing public funds to the best SMEs in Europe, the ‘EU Innovation Champions’. We test our methodology on a sample of SMEs operating in the digital sector. We found that the SMEs awarded the grants are less engaged in the challenging dimensions of Open Innovation than companies that did not receive any funding. This is contrary to the intended goals of the grants. We provide policy and methodological implications relevant for the design of better OI-informed policy and the more effective evaluation of companies participating in the SME Instrument. This paper presents an analytical framework for assessing the emergence of a new policy paradigm labelled “transformative innovation policy”, which can be seen as layered upon, but not fully replacing, earlier policy paradigms of science and technology policy and innovation systems policy. The paper establishes conceptual diversity in this emerging policy paradigm. Despite a common agenda for transformative change, there are notable differences concerning the understanding of the innovation process. Two global initiatives to promote such new innovation policies, Mission Innovation and the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, are used to illustrate how different articulations of transformative innovation policy are expressed in practice. These may be seen as a positive expression of the breadth of the emerging policy paradigm. While there are grounds for such a positive reading, this paper ends with a caution by stressing the political nature of paradigm change and the strong legacy of an economic, firm-centred and technology-oriented tradition in innovation policy. It makes a plea for more emphasis on a broader conceptualization of transformative innovation, and suggests that a socio-technical understanding of innovation provides several appropriate analytical concepts that can help to shape our thinking and understanding of transformative innovation policy.},

  abstract = {Ongoing globalisation combined with the rapid pace of technological change have generated significant growth in economic activities and have improved the welfare and living standards of many people around the world. The opening up of the world economy has also led to unprecedented surges in international trade and has fundamentally transformed the way that goods and services are produced, exchanged and consumed. In addition, the increasing separation of production and consumption activities has been accompanied by an increase in energy, resource and carbon content embodied in international trade. In general all economic activity requires the use of energy, which has a variety of environmental impacts. This dissertation examines how the relationship between energy use and economic growth evolved in high-income countries from 1970 to 2014 and the role of trade in this. The approach involves looking at the factors driving the change, how the importance of these factors has changed over time and how it differed across countries.},

Whilst much of the effort has been on energy generation from biomass, there is considerable interest on biomass availability and utilization for other end uses. With about 1\% of the world's commercial forest areas, Sweden provides about 10\% of the sawnwood, and pulp and paper that is traded on the global market. The Swedish agricultural sector also contributes to biomass availability, not only by production of sustainable food crops, but also by utilizing side streams and underutilized land for biomaterial purposes. To meet the challenges that climate change presents, there has to be a shift to sustainable biomass production and increased interest in promoting a circular bioeconomy. This review presents a systematic assessment on the availability of biomass and its utilization potential in Sweden. The review also focuses on biomass production and trade in the Swedish forest industry. In addition, the environmental impact of biomass utilization is discussed. [GRAPHICS] .},

  abstract = {In Sweden, the majority of forest area has been altered by industrial forestry over the decades. Almost 30 years ago, a shift towards biodiversity-oriented forest management practices occurred. Here we took advantage of long-term data collected by the Swedish National Forest Inventory to track developmental changes in forest structural components over this time. We assessed changes in structural components that play an important role in biodiversity (dead wood, large living trees, tree species composition, and understory vegetation) in four forest types with descending tiers of biodiversity protection: protected areas, woodland key habitats, low-productivity forests and production forests. Overall, we found a positive trend in the volumes of dead wood and large living trees, as well as in tree species diversity, while there was a general decline in understory vegetation coverage. Most observed changes were consistent with the intended outcomes of the current forest policy, adapted in the early 1990s. The implementation of retention forestry is likely driving some of the observed changes in forest structural components in the south. In contrast, we observed no changes in any of the focal structural components in the north, which could be attributed to the ongoing clear-cutting of forests previously managed less intensively. Dead wood and large living trees increased not only in managed, but also in unmanaged forests, likely reflecting historical management. The increased tree species diversity can be explained through current forest management practices that encourages maintenance of additional tree species. Decreasing understory vegetation coverage in both dense managed and unmanaged forests suggests that factors other than forestry contribute to the ongoing changes in understory vegetation in Swedish forests. Overall, the observed increase in structural components has not yet been reflected in documented improvements for red-listed forest species, which may be due to delays in species responses to small improvements, as well as a lack of detailed monitoring. Similarly, the increased availability of forest structural components might still be insufficient to meet the specific habitat requirements of red-listed species.},

However, we argue that innovation policy has limits to what it can do, and for it to remain a useful tool for tackling societal challenges, it is necessary to re-assess its role. Thus, this paper addresses the following research questions: What are the theoretical implications of the augmented expectations of innovation policy to deliver system change, what role can innovation policy play in contributing to system change, and what conditions this role. Linking to the literature on wicked problems and radical innovations, we differentiate between disruptive and progressive system change, and show that the potential role of innovation policy differs between these two types of change. Acknowledging both the potential and limitations of innovation policy, we make a proposition for how an ambitious innovation policy contributing to system change may be conceived.},

The European Ecodesign Directive singled out machine tools as key to the sustainability transition, not least due to their high energy usage and their increasingly becoming enmeshed in cyber-physical production systems. This paper aims to find out whether the digital transformation underway in machine tools is sustainable as well as to identify its central technological pathways. Externalities in machine tools are tracked over three decades (1990–2018) by means of a multi-method setting: (1) mapping the Technological Innovation System (TIS) of machine tools; (2) co-occurrence analysis of transnational patent families, in order to reduce geographical and market distortions (Questel’s FAMPAT); and (3) analysis of the incidence of digital and sustainable technologies in machine tools patent applications (WIPO PATENTSCOPE). A smart sustainability transition is currently not hampered by a lack of smart technologies but rather by the sluggish introduction of sustainable machine tools. Cyber-physical and robot machine tools have been found to be central pathways to a smart sustainability transition. Implications for harnessing externalities reach beyond the machine tools industry.},

We discuss why this shift continues to prove elusive. We argue that rarely analyzed mutually reinforcing power structures, interests, needs, and norms within the institutions of global environmental change science obstruct rethinking and reform. The blockage created by these countervailing forces are shielded from scrutiny and change through retreats behind shields of neutrality and objectivity, stoked and legitimated by fears of losing scientific authority. These responses are maladaptive, however, since transparency and reflexivity are essential for rethinking and reform, even in contexts marked by anti-environmentalism. We therefore urge greater openness, self-critique, and power-sharing across research communities, to create spaces and support for conversations, diverse knowledges, and decisions conducive to sustainability transformations.},

This study takes E-Payment technology as an example by presenting the technological development trajectory, and by exploring the contribution of knowledge sources from different regions and various technical fields. In the process of technological trajectory evolution, different trajectory phenomena will appear in different periods, such as convergence, lock-in, and dominance in technological development. To find out the phenomenon of electronic payment technology trajectory, this study uses a patent database of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as a data source. It uses keywords to conduct a patent search, a patent citation data set is established, and the main path analysis (MPA) is performed. According to the research results, the E-payment industry technology is dominated by the United States from the country's patent ownership perspective. The combination of American Qualcomm and Firethorn Mobile has the key technology leading position on the main path of technological development. From the perspective of patentees, VISA and MasterCard have invested the most in technology R\&D to show their leading position in future technology development. According to the main path analysis of patents, the research results showed that from the year 1983 to the year 2007, technology had developed diversified, and knowledge flow in related technical fields had already expanded. In the year 2008, technological development changed with technological fusion, and the technology was locked in. After 2013, a patent for “identity verification” on transaction security appeared on the key main path. After the emergence of this core patent technology, a technological explosion occurred. Various technologies developed rapidly during this period and had continued to occur so far. Since 2008, the number of patent announcements has been in a stage of high technological growth so it can be regarded as the growth stage of the technology life cycle. In addition to the main technical analysis, payment security is the core technology of the entire payment industry. Near-field communications (NFC) technology has the most critical development trend among the related technologies developed, followed by cloud computing-related technologies.},

To design effective enabling and regulatory governance frameworks for bio-based transformation, policy makers have to identify potentially game-changing future technologies and assess associated sustainability gains and risks. Drawing on the concept of key enabling technologies (KETs) put forward by the European Commission (EC) in 2009, this paper defines KETs for the bioeconomy. Based on an international expert survey, we identified KET criteria for bioeconomic transformation and developed overarching super-categories describing technology pathways and criteria dimensions according to the existing society–environment–economy triangle. In this way, this study contributes not only in providing advice allowing new technologies to foster but also in elucidating relationships between the regional origin and the perceived future of bio-based technology development. Moreover, bioeconomy KET visions from different stakeholders have been analyzed, thus providing a basis for future technology research, evaluation, politics, and management.},

  abstract = {While global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are still rising, a number of countries have emerged with a sustained record of emissions reductions. In this article, we identify these countries and examine their progress, exploring how fast, how deep, and in which sectors they have reduced emissions. We analyse changes in all major GHG emissions sources, with both production – and consumption-based accounting, but exclude very small countries with high volatility, along with landuse, land-use change and forestry CO2 emissions. We find that 24 countries have sustained reductions in annual CO2 and GHG emissions between 1970 and 2018, in total equalling 3.2 GtCO2eq since their respective emissions peaks. In all but three countries, overall GHG reductions are less than energy and industrial CO2 reductions alone. We group countries into three types of emissions pathway: six former Eastern Bloc countries, where emissions declined rapidly in the 1990s and have continued on a downward trajectory since; six Long-term decline countries, which have sustained reductions since the 1970s; and 12 Recent peak countries, whose emissions decline began in the 2000s. In all cases, emissions reductions were achieved primarily in the energy systems sector, specifically in electricity and heat generation, which still remains the largest source of emissions in most countries. By contrast, in the transport sector, emissions tend to be stable or increasing. Transport is the second largest source of current emissions in Recent peak and Long-term decline countries. While the total GHG reductions of these 24 countries are trivial compared to recent global emissions growth, some have achieved a decline of up to 50\% in their annual emissions, showing what is possible even under very moderate climate action. Most countries achieved emissions reductions alongside sustained economic growth, and some approached the fast annual rates of change that will be needed across the world in the coming decades to limit warming to 2°C. This raises the hope that more substantive climate policy, as planned in a growing number of countries, may bring about deeper and more rapid emissions reductions than some may expect today.},

  abstract = {Innovation is at the heart of policy discussions on how to achieve transformative change for sustainable development. Over the past decades, the systems of innovation approach has gained widespread use and is arguably the most influential framework guiding innovation scholars and policymakers today. Notwithstanding its explanatory power, the systems of innovation approach is mainly directed at optimising innovation systems to fulfil national economic policy objectives, such as growth, jobs, and competitiveness. The frame of reference has changed following the adoption of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and with it, the requirements for conceptual approaches that underpin innovation policy. It is increasingly understood that addressing societal challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change, requires more than optimising innovation systems to fulfil economic policy objectives but also inducing directionality and processes of transformative change toward a broader range of societal and environmental objectives. This ‘normative’ turn towards transformative innovation policy is grounded in an understanding of system innovation of socio-technical systems towards more sustainable modes of production and consumption. The objective of this research is to conceptually refine the systems of innovation approach, and in particular revise the national innovation systems concept, thereby taking steps towards the development of a more integrative innovation policy framework that incorporates directionality and a strategic orientation of innovation systems to address contemporary societal challenges of the type of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Focussing mainly on the needs and challenges of developing countries to accumulate the capabilities needed to manage innovation and technological change, three separate case studies are used to validate central features of transformative innovation policy: capabilities, networks, and directionality. The first empirical chapter develops an understanding of how a Brazilian latecomer firm accumulated the capabilities needed to pursue innovation in new and different directions along more sustainable development pathways. The second empirical chapter furthers the understanding of how the formation of global innovation networks enhances interactive learning in national innovation systems, and in what way international technology cooperation complements creation and accumulation of innovation capabilities. A mapping of the growing number and variety of international cooperative initiatives in the context of climate change helps to illustrate the different forms of global innovation networks. The third empirical chapter integrates insights from the system innovation perspective and opens up the systems of innovation approach to incorporate directionality and a strategic orientation of innovation systems towards a broader range of societal and environmental objectives. The compatibility of the innovation policy framework is assessed with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals.},

This paper aims to transcend the diversity of locally specific terms and forms, to highlight the value of considering them inclusively. Building on methods to make sense of diversity, we use reflexive grounded inquiry in fifteen cases in Italy, Scotland, Slovenia and Sweden. Within four dimensions (forest, community, relationships between them, and relationships with wider society), we identify 43 subdimensions to describe them collectively. Our approach shows how European arrangements contribute to wider discourses of collective natural resource management. Both tradition and innovation in Europe inform options for environmental governance. Arrangements challenge the distinction between `communities of place' and `communities of interest', with implications for social and environmental justice. They exemplify multilevel environmental governance through both vertical and horizontal connections. Emerging from long histories of political and environmental pressures, they have a role in enhancing society's connection with nature and adaptive capacity.},

  abstract = {One of the most important challenges of the 21st century is the quest for economic development models that respect the planet's ecosystem. Rather than imposing our industrial systems on nature, why not let nature influence our industrial and innovation systems? From wind turbine blades to bullet trains and solar cells, many of the technologies we rely on today have been inspired by solutions found in nature. Although relatively widespread in the fields of architecture and engineering, biomimicry/biomimetics remains largely overlooked in economics, public policy, and development studies. This is paradoxical because the world's remaining biodiversity stock-a knowledge bank of solutions to both current and unknown challenges- is largely held in developing economies and can be leveraged as a source of inspiration for -and entry door to- industrial innovation. This paper, therefore, investigates the relevance of biomimicry in the formulation of sustainable development strategies in biodiverse developing countries and maps out the national policy landscapes that can advance it. Several findings arise from this study. First, despite the exponential growth of biomimicry as a field and our understanding of its economic impact, what drives nature-inspired innovation remains elusive. Second, the biomimicry innovation landscape is dominated by industrialised economies that have relied on proactive policy interventions, while virtually no developing country has adopted biomimicry as an innovation strategy, consolidating the exploitation of the biodiversity in the developing world by firms in high-income nations. Third, by drawing on empirical evidence from a selection of Latin American countries, this paper shows that while biomimicry presents tremendous opportunities to leapfrog towards high value-added knowledge-intensive activities by using local biodiversity and related expertise as factor endowments, policy, and institutional factors have led to the persistence of important coordination failures that hinder the expansion and commercialization of biomimicry-based R\&D. This paper concludes by discussing the public policies needed to support the integration of developing nations at the innovation frontier through biomimicry.},

We develop three measures of attitudes towards the concepts: An implicit position based on responses to statements related to the debate on economic growth and the environment, a position choice based on choosing one concept without referring to its name and an explicit position based on choosing a concept with reference to its name. The analysis leads to four major results. (1) Environmental protection specialists predominantly express a preference for growth-critical concepts (a-growth/post-growth and degrowth) as compared to green growth. (2) A-growth/post-growth is the most favoured concept. (3) The results are stable for all three attitude-measures. (4) Specialists with more knowledge on the concepts are even more likely to prefer growth-critical concepts. Our results further support previous empirical findings that a large share of people and, in particular, specialists are in favour of growth-critical concepts, making policy-options towards such concepts more feasible.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) has twenty two Member States with common goals of engaging in European space activities. However, the various Member States have a variety of governance structures, strategic priorities regarding space and other sectorial areas depending on their cultural and geopolitical aspirations. The Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, have similarities which result often in common geopolitical and cultural aspects. These in turn shape their respective priorities and interests in setting up their policies in a number of sectorial areas like shipping and fisheries, energy, immigration, agriculture, security and defence, infrastructures, climate change and the Arctic. Space technology, navigation, earth observation, telecommunication and integrated applications can assist the Nordic countries in developing, implementing and monitoring policies of common interest. This paper provides an in-depth overview and a comprehensive assessment of these common interests in policy areas where space can provide support in their realisation. The first part provides a synthesis of the Nordic countries respective priorities through analysing their government programmes and plans. The priorities are classified according to the six areas of sustainability: energy, environment and climate change, transport, knowledge and innovation, natural resources (fisheries, agriculture, forestry, mining, etc), and security and external relations. Although the national strategies present different national perspectives, at the same time, there are a number of similarities when it comes to overall policy objectives in a number of areas such as the Arctic and climate change. In other words, even though the Arctic plays a different role in each country's national context and there are clear differences as regards geography, access to resources and security policies, the strategies display common general interest in sustainable development and management of resources, protection of the environment, international cooperation and regional security. The second part of this paper focuses on the national space strategies and indicates the main priorities and trends. The priorities vary from one country to the other and can include science, navigation, earth observation, human space flight, launchers, technology development, and/or applications. The motivation for investing in space activities also change (e.g. international cooperation, industrial competitiveness, societal benefits, job creation). (C) 2016 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In Study 1, we find that systems thinkers tend to believe in scientific consensus, recognize risks posed by climate change, and support policy interventions to address climate change; systems thinking was negatively related to conspiracist and free-market ideation. In Studies 2 and 3 we find that systems thinkers ascribe more value to the natural world — both in monetary terms as well as on social and ecological grounds.

In many cases, however, the separation planning of underground coal mining (UCM) and mine reclamation (MR) and “mining first, reclamation later” lead to the accumulation of land degradation. Thus, the integrated planning of UCM and MR needs to be studied urgently. In this study, concurrent mining and reclamation (CMR) technologies were adopted to divide UCM planning into four key steps from the space-time scale: i) development roadway (macro); ii) preparation roadway (moderate); iii) panel roadway (meso) and iv) working face (micro), and the impacts of mining steps on MR were discussed. In addition, the requirements of four-key links of MR for UCM were discussed: i) reclamation elevation (RE); ii) digging depth (DD); iii) reclamation layout (RL), and iv) reclamation timing (RT). UCM and MR were optimized on macro, moderate, meso, and micro scales. Results show that: (1) RE and DD are moderate and meso scales; (2) RL is macro and moderate scales; (3) RT is meso and micro scales. Integrated planning of UCM and MR can reduce mining damage from the source, which can timely reclaim degraded land, and alleviate the contradictions of the government, colliery and farmer. We hope CMR will be valued to jointly improve application scenarios and guide sustainable mining.},

  abstract = {Technological innovation is an important way to reduce carbon emissions in the logistics industry. Using panel data of the logistics industry in China's 30 provinces from 2002 to 2019, a dynamic spatial Durbin model was constructed to explore the impact of logistics technological innovation on carbon emissions, and determine whether there is a rebound effect. Furthermore, the rebound effect of logistics technological innovation was calculated, and its spatial-temporal characteristics were analyzed. It was found that there is a “U”-shaped relationship between logistics technological innovation and carbon emissions at the national and regional levels, which means that the impact of logistics technological innovation on carbon emissions has a rebound effect. Moreover, the spatial spillover of technological innovation strengthens the rebound effect, while the optimization of the energy structure weakens it. Further calculation showed that the average spatial rebound effect is 60.61\%, which is 22.66\% higher than the average direct rebound effect. The spatial rebound effect has obvious regional heterogeneity, with the highest in the central region, followed by the eastern region, and the lowest in the western region. For temporal variation, at the national level, the spatial rebound effect was successively shown as a backfire effect, partial rebound effect, super energy-saving effect, and partial rebound effect. Similarly, three regions fluctuate circularly in these rebound effects with different forms. Thus, the rebound effect can be alleviated through energy structure optimization, energy price marketization, and a regional collaborative development mechanism.},

Its economic and institutional foundations are set forth using an endogenous theory of economic development in the spirit of Marx, Schumpeter and Veblen. Technological and institutional change lead interdependently to the emergence of socio-technical complexes which are subject to ideological appropriation. These complexes are analyzed as actor-networks from an ontological perspective and exemplified using special cases in the information and communication technologies (ICTs). The approach contributes to synthesizing critical political economy with actornetwork theory. Technology appropriation is elaborated as a means of repurposing existing technologies in terms of recombination, with an emphasis on the strategy of habilitation. This political economic strategy delivers new insights for a solidary mode of economic reproduction in a low-carbon de-growing economy.},

We find that genuine savings may have been negative up until c. 1910. This suggests a period of transition to positive genuine savings in conjunction with or even preceding the transition to modem economic rates. Important contributions to the transition were increasing investments in human capital, improved sanitary conditions, reduced depletion of forests and accelerated investments in machinery and infrastructure.

Referring to weak and strong sustainability approaches, many authors stated that bioeconomy is related only to weak sustainability, but this study provides a framework for policy makers that allows the definition and implementation of the bioeconomy based on the strong sustainability approach. Furthermore, researchers evaluating bioeconomy implementation conventionally encompassed the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of the impact of bio-products; however, they did not consider the strong sustainability approach. Strong sustainability additionally requires not crossing ecological thresholds and, thus, implies consideration of planetary boundaries. Therefore, the inclusion of land footprint and biocapacity measures in the bioeconomy strategy, verifying that the land footprint does not exceed the level of biocapacity, is essential for the creation of a strongly sustainable bioeconomy. This study embarks on the definition of the bioeconomy based on strong sustainability and contributes to the discussion about bioeconomy implementation in the context of sustainable development.},

In this paper, we explore the VBA of stakeholders involved in three water management projects focusing on dams, micro-reservoirs, or wetlands in a Peruvian watershed facing droughts. We apply a framework with the core ideas of the hydrosocial cycle, the decision context perspective, and the VBA hierarchy to show how stakeholders’ perspectives and power influence practices on the ground. The analysis of VBA reveals three different perspectives on water management held by different stakeholder groups. First, a community-based perspective, frequent among local communities, favors micro-reservoirs managed by communities. Second, an infrastructure-based perspective, frequent among public sector stakeholders, shows a preference for dams managed by the private sector. Third, a nature-based perspective, with a preference for wetlands managed by the public sector, is found across stakeholder groups. In the three water management projects, different power distributions determine which VBA dominate and influence practices on the ground. Dams on the ground represent power from the public and private sectors, while micro-reservoirs represent local grassroot control. In the wetland project, the outcomes of the evolving hydrosocial cycle are still unclear and will depend on how multiple perspectives are considered. Examining and questioning the decision context in which adaptation occurs can help excluded stakeholders achieve more power and agency and tackle the fundamental question of ‘adaptation of what and for whom’.},

As a consequence of differences in actors' power to influence forest management, certain goals and silvicultural ideals will be promoted at the expense of others and thereby homogenize forest management. At the same time, “ideal” outcomes are often hard to achieve in practice and forest owners might not be willing to fully implement programs promoted by the state or industrial actors due to conflicting ideas. In southern Sweden a profit and production-oriented paradigm bolstered by powerful industrial forestry actors promotes clearcutting with Norway spruce (Picea abies) or Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) on the areas managed for timber production. Through qualitative interviews with forestry advisors and desk research this study investigates challenges associated with promoting these production-oriented silvicultural ideals among small-scale private forest owners. The study highlights deviations of actual practices from the silvicultural ideals, and explores forest advisors’ perceptions of causes of these deviations, thereby providing insights into challenges associated with production-oriented steering through advisory services. In the studied case, owners and advisors have had to cope with extreme storms and severe browsing damages. Interviewed advisors also perceived a number other factors to be associated with deviations, such as lack of time or knowledge among owners, high costs associated with pre-commercial thinning and owner preferences.},

The Swedish forest management system is a deregulated system structured by the governing principle of “freedom with responsibility.” By investigating how responsibility is understood and enacted by forest consultants and forest owners, we demonstrate the practical fluidity of the responsibility concept. We emphasize the need for an understanding of responsibility that fosters sensitivity and adaptiveness to external issues and actors in the face of uncertainty, and identify obstacles in current forestry policy and practice to enacting such an understanding.},

Sustainable development is used here as a common notion referring to those persistent problems in (Western industrialized) societies that can only be dealt with on the very long term (decades or more) through specific types of network and decision-making processes. Based on interdisciplinary research into complex processes of long term, structural change in society, basic tenets for complexity-based governance are formulated. These tenets are translated into a framework that distinguishes between four different types of governance activities and their respective roles in societal transitions. This framework can be used for implementation of governance strategies and instruments. The approach and framework have been developed deductively and inductively in the Netherlands since 2000. This article presents the theoretical basis of transition management and will be illustrated by examples from transition management practice, especially the Dutch national energy transition program.},

We synthesize empirical work from two European research projects (TRANSIT and ARTS), in which initiatives and networks were empirically studied, to develop a broader conceptual understanding of the emergence of transformative innovation. The development of initiatives can occur through growing, replicating, partnering, instrumentalising and embedding. This is supported through translocal networks that connect initiatives by sharing ideas, objects and activities across local contexts. This translocal characteristic of transformative innovations harnesses an enormous potential for sustainability transitions, but requires further understanding as well as governance support. The perspective we present provides a conceptual starting point to further explore the development and diffusion of transformative innovation as well as transition governance strategies.},

  abstract = {This study provides an explanation of the different pathways of agricultural change and economic development in north and south Vietnam. It shows that pre-colonial factor endowments conditioned the development of the rice economies of the two deltas in Tonkin and Cochinchina. The study relates to, and deviates from, the new literature on the colonial origins of contemporary development (Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson; Engerman and Sokoloff), and proposes an alternative understanding of how historical processes of economic transformation are shaped. The analysis revives the factor endowment approach (Boserup, Myint), re-interprets an old and controversial debate (Moral Economy versus Rational Peasant), and presents a new understanding of extraction in colonial times (based on Milanovic, Lindert and Williamson). The study’s theoretical interpretation of scant empirical data suggests that factor endowments conditioned the surplus capacity and shaped the institutional arrangements, which affected the equality of opportunity for the majority of rice farmers.},

Although these crises are global phenomena, the regional dimension plays a crucial role, as regions both provide the conditions for the development of environmental innovations and promote widespread use and diffusion. Against this background, this article has two objectives. Firstly, we critically review the state of research on regional determinants of environmental innovation. Secondly, based on these results, we develop an agenda for further research in regional studies that will help to better understand the geography of environmental innovation and to come up with useful region-specific policy recommendations.},

Using a Q-methodology approach the emphasis is also put on identification of differences between the opinions of small individual entrepreneurs and representatives of capital companies. Based on the results of structured interview with representatives of 33 wood processing companies the main findings suggest that future innovation activities in the sector will be related to the technology innovations mainly in processing of coniferous timber. However, the extent of such innovations is perceived differently depending on the company size and ownership category. While small individual entrepreneurs expect only slight innovation changes in the industry aimed at the meeting of required standards, managers of capital companies tend to foresee the future vision in restructuralisation of wood-processing industry.},

In this study we develop an analytical definition of forest-based bioeconomy, grounded on input from European forestry and bioeconomy capacity mapping exercises from five projects and with participation of five experts from different backgrounds. Variables related to innovation development are based on open innovation concept and literature review of studies focused on bioeconomy context. Data is gathered on innovations developed by private companies within forest-based bioeconomy projects of Seventh Framework Programme, EU Research and Innovation Programme Horizon 2020 and projects funded through the Network co-fund of the European Research Area. Most frequent types of innovations are within the development of production methods, followed by innovations in goods and services. There are few innovation cases in later stages of development, and more disruptive and complex innovations are usually more successful ones. Successful innovations also depend on support from organizational leadership and on external financial support. Project-based funding in innovation development is offset by the revenue generated from these innovations. Vast majority of companies considers the EU framework projects as a useful tool for supporting the development of innovations.},

  abstract = {Abstract   The term “social innovation” (SI) is currently applied to denote a broad range of activities connected to explicit goals and supposedly designed to address inherent societal problems. These problems are rooted in current economic and ecological crises, such as poverty, unemployment, forced migration, brain drain, social inequality or environmental destruction. This article focuses on the EU and national policies that have the potential to support Social Innovation in rural areas and maps possible future policy efforts in this regard. However, many of the policies that we find to have potential for possible effective social innovation support do not have much in common concerning their targets. In consequence, the article outlines a threefold typology for categorizing the different policy targets that have impacts on social innovation in rural areas: (i) policies targeting vulnerable social groups, (ii) policies targeting societal challenges at large and (iii) policies targeting the participatory inclusion of civil society. In addition we outline enabling and hindering policy factors for social innovation and we apply the threefold typology to the example of forest policy. The conceptual framework in combination with the forest policy objectives we identify provides a useful basis for further research in this area.},

  abstract = {The forest sector in various ways fosters employment, community development and prevents depopulation in marginalized rural areas. Since the economic recession in Europe from 2009, there has been a notable change regarding the roles that public and private actors play in tackling current social and economic problems. The term Social Innovation (SI) came up to denote the overcoming of complex societal challenges with an increase of engagement of civil society (private actors). So far, collective values of ecosystem services, health and recreational benefits have been researched extensively. But the role of policies in socially innovative forest sector activities for the enhancement of collective action and collective benefits still leaves room for research. This article asks how relevant were policies as drivers of institutional change for forestry related examples of social innovation? The question is examined across different European countries with a focus on the policies identified as relevant for these innovations by a panel of experts and researchers. We used selected case studies in combination with literature as well as policy document analysis and complementary policy expert interviews. We focus on the policies that have affected these activities and investigate in detail on their relevance for the outcome (the SI). Our findings indicate that there is more than one direction of policies impacting upon the SI initiatives, because vice-versa, there is also SI impacting on the policies. Both directions lead to institutional change in the final outcomes, either in the policy design (bottom-up influence) or in the social innovation (ultimately changes in the actors-institutions relations and the creation of new institutions with the SI). Policies can be either drivers of SI or they can be outcome when new policies were created because of the transformative effects of SI. Furthermore, we detect policies that turn out “neutral” towards social innovation at the moment but with potential effects in future.},

  abstract = {There are few studies on the impact of economic cycles on green purchasing (GP) and green activism (GA). This study investigates whether times of well-being and crisis have different effects on internal factors (psychographic factors (PF), motivations, attitudes and perceived consumer effectiveness (PCE)) and external factors (environmental information and marketing mix) that influence ecological behaviours (GA and GP). To that end, a longitudinal analysis is carried out in Spain distinguishing between times of economic crisis (2008–2012) and times of well-being (2014–2019). Our findings show a clear influence of the economic context, which acts as a moderating variable in the link between internal and external factors and ecological behaviour. PF and GA influence GP, and that influence is more pronounced in times of economic crisis. The PF with the greatest influence on GA and GP in times of crisis is motivation, followed by PCE, while in times of well-being context the effects of both these top factors are similar. Within marketing variables, product and price have more influence on GP than promotion and place in times of economic crisis, and price has no effect in times of well-being. The influence of environmental information (EI) is also greater in times of crisis than in times of well-being. Thus, during economic crises the dissemination of EI among consumers plays an important role in environmental attitudes, which in turn influence GP positively. However, high prices of green products affect GP negatively in times of crisis, which could explain the lower levels of GP found. These findings are useful for public bodies, companies and educational institutions, which need to take the economic cycle into account when developing actions and strategies to encourage ecological behaviour.},

  abstract = {In a broad sense, one that includes foresters, nature conservation organizations and the informed public in Sweden, it is common knowledge that the era of clear-cutting in northern Sweden began around 1950. This paper presents results of a study showing that this is a much too simplistic view. The main objective was to analyze how clear-cutting was discussed professionally and implemented in northern Sweden during the late 19th century and early 20th. We also wanted to discuss the development of forest management in this region from a comparative perspective. The study is based on a detailed analysis of extensive historical records from 1882 to 1960 and includes papers and reports from discussions and field excursions. The results of the study show that clear-cutting was widely applied in northern Sweden in the early 1900s as the interest in sustainable forest management and regeneration increased. The foresters wanted to improve the situation in the residual stands that were left after high-grading of Scots pine and, at the same time, the expanding pulp industry improved the market for smaller diameter trees and Norway spruce, making it possible to apply clear-cutting on a larger scale. A rapidly expanding wood market pushed a timber frontier northwards in Sweden and along with this came new knowledge and technology. During the 1930s, the financial crisis led to a temporary decline in clear-cutting in favor of selective cutting, but after that clear-cutting took over more and more. Rather than being a dramatic shift between cutting methods, the transition was a gradual process during which both clear-cutting and selective cutting were seen as rational cutting methods and therefore constantly applied and refined. With time, however, selective cutting was abandoned in favor of clear-cutting. The reason for keeping a persistent myth around the introduction of clear-cutting has its roots in the transformation process but also through the need for a positive historical narrative among foresters in Sweden.},

In Sweden, the breaking point for modern forestry is generally considered to be around 1950. Recently, our common knowledge of the implementation of clear-cutting in Sweden has increased, and new research indicates that clear-cutting systems were already applied before the 1950s. In this case study, we used aerial photographs from the 1940s to analyze the extent of contemporaneous clear-cuts and even-aged young forests in an area in northern Sweden. Our results show that almost 40\% of the study area had already been clear-cut by the end of the 1940s, but also that clear-cutting had been applied to 10\% of the forest land in the early 1900s. This implies that the historical development of forestry in northern Sweden is more complex than previously thought, and that certain proportions of the forest land were already second-generation forests in the 1950s. Our results have implications for the use of concepts such as “continuity forest”, suggesting that this concept should employ a time frame of at least 100 years.},

  abstract = {Old-growth forests remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at rates that vary with climate and nitrogen deposition. The sequestered carbon dioxide is stored in live woody tissues and slowly decomposing organic matter in litter and soil. Old-growth forests therefore serve as a global carbon dioxide sink, but they are not protected by international treaties, because it is generally thought that ageing forests cease to accumulate carbon. Here we report a search of literature and databases for forest carbon-flux estimates. We find that in forests between 15 and 800 years of age, net ecosystem productivity (the net carbon balance of the forest including soils) is usually positive. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forests can continue to accumulate carbon, contrary to the long-standing view that they are carbon neutral. Over 30 per cent of the global forest area is unmanaged primary forest, and this area contains the remaining old-growth forests. Half of the primary forests (6 x 10(8) hectares) are located in the boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. On the basis of our analysis, these forests alone sequester about 1.3 +/- 0.5 gigatonnes of carbon per year. Thus, our findings suggest that 15 per cent of the global forest area, which is currently not considered when offsetting increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, provides at least 10 per cent of the global net ecosystem productivity. Old-growth forests accumulate carbon for centuries and contain large quantities of it. We expect, however, that much of this carbon, even soil carbon, will move back to the atmosphere if these forests are disturbed.},

This article suggests, that these recent efforts risk falling into a scalar trap, because they rely on a theoretical assumption about the policy effectiveness of the subnational scale. In response, the paper proposes a constructivist approach to the spatial organization of transformative innovation policy. The constructivist approach views scale as continuously produced and contested by actors. Moreover, it suggests that rescaling may be an important aspect of multi-level governance of transformative innovation policy because it has the potential to alter the influence of actors in the prevailing socio-technical system. The approach is illustrated with an empirical analysis of waste management in Denmark where a transformative innovation policy has recently been introduced, rescaling decision-making away from a traditionally strong subnational scalar arrangement.},

Technological lock-in has resulted from the coevolution of crop systems (based on the post-WWII agrochemical paradigm), public policies, and market dynamics that promote major crops such as cereals. This chapter explains how interrelated factors have favored increasing returns to adoption for cereals to the detriment of minor crops. The evolutionary economics approach used here identifies the main economic mechanisms that reinforce the choice of an initial production pathway. Today with the development of the bio-economy, we also examine whether new technological pathways in the agro-food sector may be able to reverse this lock-in.},

This paper contributes to this literature by theorizing complementarity formation mechanisms underlying such positive interactions within and across technology value chains. It pursues empir­ ically founded theory building based on a case study of innovation in battery-electric, hydrogen and liquefied biogas technologies in Norwegian coastal shipping. Three complementarity formation mechanisms in technology value chains are identified: synchronization, amplification, and integration. Synchronization points to the need for co-development between the input and user sectors of a technology value chain. Amplification refers to the necessary expansion of input sectors to match the growing demand in user sectors. Finally, integration highlights the potential of convergence between different technology value chains in one or more user sectors. The paper concludes with a discussion of how policy may leverage such complementarity formation mechanisms to foster innovation in zero‑carbon technologies.},

Using a simple conceptual model for the occurrence of extreme weather events, we show that if the objective is to minimize forecast error, an alternative approach wherein likelihoods of impact are continually updated as data become available is preferable. Using a simple Bproofof-concept,\^ we show that such an approach will, under rather general assumptions, yield more accurate forecasts. We also argue that such an approach will better serve society, in providing a more effective means to alert decision-makers to potential and unfolding harms and avoid opportunity costs. In short, a Bayesian approach is preferable, both empirically and ethically.},

These challenges are rooted in the diversity of forest ecosystems and institutional contexts, a lack of system understanding, of innovation dynamics, the public good character of many FES, and a production-oriented reference frame for forest management. We use a set of good governance innovation practices in form of new actor alliances and payment schemes as a basis for assessment and learning how to promote different kinds or bundles of FES. The contributing authors of the SI combine several methodological approaches to understand the working conditions of such innovations, including integrated mapping, stakeholder and governance analysis, and a forward-looking scenario approach for innovation assessment. Applying multi-methods and multi-actor approaches fruitfully orchestrated a constructive debate among stakeholders on the chances and challenges of governance innovations in Europe, to allow for their uptake in forest policy, business and practice.},

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way. As the paper shows through alternative uses of Smart technologies and digital open-source fabrication, the question is not so much around technology per se but around the wider politicoeconomic context into which these technological assemblages are embedded.},

An ideal TIS life cycle representation is suggested and three empirical examples of long-term TIS development and decline are discussed.

For example, new products and industries emerge that exacerbate existing challenges, instead of mitigating them. Context systems such as policy making, finance, education or independent journalism, which provide critical resources for transitions, transform in ways that hamper their ability to support sustainability transitions. We argue that transitions research needs explicitly to confront unfavorable developments in order to create a broader repertoire of strategies, including precautionary policies, to better orchestrate sustainability transitions.},

The analysis reveals how the emerging field of SPIS drew upon a growing range of disciplines in the late 1950s and 1960s, and how the relationship with these disciplines evolved over time. Around the mid-1980s, substantial parts of SPIS started to coalesce into a more coherent field centred on the adoption of an evolutionary (or neo-Schumpeterian) economics framework, an interactive model of the innovation process, and (a little later) the concept of ‘systems of innovation’ and the resource-based view of the firm. The article concludes with a discussion of whether SPIS is perhaps in the early stages of becoming a discipline.},

In this study, we engage with empirical operationalization of what is ‘related’ in related variety. We argue, based on theoretical grounds, that estimating regional knowledge production functions requires related variety measures that capture the recombination of knowledge explicitly. To test this proposition, we develop a set of related variety indicators that account for indirect linkages between industries and allow these linkages to vary over time. Empirically, we estimate the relationship between regional innovation output and regional industry mix in Swedish regions between 1991 and 2010. Our results suggest that related variety measures based on dynamic recombinant relatedness are superior in predicting regional innovation output.},

This particular type of network is gaining increasing attention. However, despite evidence of the importance of brokerage dynamics for knowledge mobility anchored in science and technology research, three main questions remain open: Who acts as network broker in TTNs? What are their specific functions? What mechanisms do they adopt to support these functions? To answer these questions, we conducted an in-depth multi-case study focusing on three European centers of excellence in scientific research, namely the University of Cambridge (UK), the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland), and the Italian Institute of Technology (Italy). We find that institutional actors as well as individuals act as network brokers in TTNs, and that brokerage manifests with varying degrees of formalization related to the TTN's level of maturity. We also identify six network brokerage functions, namely conflict resolution, spreading knowledge, linking idea fragments, connecting problems to solutions, expanding the network, and strengthening the network, and five mechanisms, namely endorsement, mediation, events, antennas, and digital support systems, that support these functions.},

  abstract = {Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks, particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting, generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species, with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores, reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest research to address the gaps.},

We utilize the Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) framework to assess these relations in European agriculture, for 220 NUTS2 regions. We put a particular focus on individual land system components, i.e. croplands, grasslands, and livestock husbandry and relate associated biomass flows to the potential net primary productivity NPP. For the reference year 2012, we find that 469~g~dm/m2/yr (38\% of NPPpot) of used biomass were harvested on total agricultural land, and that one tonne of annually harvested biomass is associated with 1.67 tonnes dry matter (dm) of HANPP, ranging from 0.8 to 8.1 tonnes dry matter (dm) across all regions. EU livestock systems are a large consumer of these provisioning ecosystem services, and invoking higher HANPP flows than current HANPP on cropland and grassland within the EU, even exceeding the potential NPP in one fifth of all NUTS2 regions. NPP remaining in ecosystems after provisioning society with biomass is essential for the functioning of ecosystems and is 563~g~dm/m2/yr or 46\% of NPPpot on all agricultural land. We conclude from our analysis that the HANPP framework provides useful indicators that should be integrated in future ecosystem service assessments.},

  abstract = {Zipf's law is a hallmark of several complex systems with a modular structure, such as books composed by words or genomes composed by genes. In these component systems, Zipf's law describes the empirical power-law distribution of component frequencies. Stochastic processes based on a sample-space-reducing (SSR) mechanism, in which the number of accessible states reduces as the system evolves, have been recently proposed as a simple explanation for the ubiquitous emergence of this law. However, many complex component systems are characterized by other statistical patterns beyond Zipf's law, such as a sublinear growth of the component vocabulary with the system size, known as Heap's law, and a specific statistics of shared components. This work shows, with analytical calculations and simulations, that these statistical properties can emerge jointly from a SSR mechanism, thus making it an appropriate parameter-poor representation for component systems. Several alternative (and equally simple) models, for example, based on the preferential attachment mechanism, can also reproduce Heaps' and Zipf's laws, suggesting that additional statistical properties should be taken into account to select the most-likely generative process for a specific system. Along this line, we will show that the temporal component distribution predicted by the SSR model is markedly different from the one emerging from the popular rich-gets-richer mechanism. A comparison with empirical data from natural language indicates that the SSR process can be chosen as a better candidate model for text generation based on this statistical property. Finally, a limitation of the SSR model in reproducing the empirical “burstiness” of word appearances in texts will be pointed out, thus indicating a possible direction for extensions of the basic SSR process.},

Mission-oriented innovation has required public agencies to not only “de-risk” the private sector, but also to lead the direct creation of new technological opportunities and market landscapes.

The role of bioenergy in the bioeconomy is discussed particularly through biofuels for transport and biorefineries. The study finds that the definitions of the bioeconomy are evolving and vary depending on the actor, but display similarities such as the emphasis on economic output and a broad, cross-sectoral focus. While there is great optimism about the benefits and opportunities associated with developing an advanced bioeconomy in Europe, significant risks and trade-offs are also expressed. Furthermore, the bioeconomy concept has been criticised for presenting a technical fix and pre-empting alternative visions. To advance a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy, this paper calls for attention on two important themes: participatory governance that engages the general public and key stakeholders in an open and informed dialogue as well as a commitment by government and industry to innovation that drives concerted efforts on sustainable development of the bioeconomy.},

Ethical, epistemological and methodological challenges are examined in reference to open access agendas, the politics of knowledge production, and transformations in research practices in the era of data management. We first consider practical and interpretive decisions in archiving qualitative data, then map current policy and regulatory frameworks governing research data management, taking Australia as a case-study. We argue that governance and protocols for data sharing have not attended sufficiently to the distinctive ethical and methodological dimensions and knowledge claims of qualitative research. Instead, approaches associated with quantitative data are extrapolated in ways which construct an imaginary of decontextualised data, abstracted from the conditions of its production. We further argue for more critical attention to the double-edged affordances and ambivalent effects of data sharing and openness and to how data archives are imagined, constructed and curated. This includes greater acknowledgement of the affective and temporal dynamics involved in data archiving, understanding them as practices of (re)invention that also curate ‘archives for the future’ and help to foster an historicising imaginary in educational research.},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that sustainability-oriented innovation may require different circumstances within organizations than traditional innovation research has revealed. More specifically, nature-inspired innovation (NII) has become increasingly common in recent years, and yet it is not fully understood how it is perceived within adopting organizations. This study addresses this gap by identifying how individual accounts collectively form organizational narratives that shape sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) processes within MNCs and three SOI narratives of amongst teams implementing NII in seven multinational corporations. Cases were selected for their application of NII approaches including biomimicry, cradle to cradle, circular economy, and industrial ecology (collectively referred to as nature-inspired innovation). Using data generated from semi-structured interviews (n~=~52) and NII project documents, three types of organizational narratives related to SOI were identified: Ambiguous, Accountable, and Aspirational. Narratives of SOI in organizations adopting NII are strongly influenced by overall stage of corporate sustainability; the engagement of leadership, and the innovation infrastructure and culture.},

  abstract = {The climate crisis demands a strong response from policy-makers worldwide. The current global climate policy agenda requires technological change, innovation, labour markets and the financial system to be led towards an orderly and rapid low-carbon transition. Yet progress has been slow and incremental. Inadequacies of policy appraisal frameworks used worldwide may be significant contributors to the problem, as they frequently fail to adequately account for the dynamics of societal and technological change. Risks are underestimated, and the economic opportunities from innovation are generally not assessed in practice. Here, we identify root causes of those inadequacies and identify them to structural features of standard analysis frameworks. We use a review of theoretical principles of complexity science and the science of dynamical systems and formulate a generalisation of existing frameworks for policy analysis and the appraisal of outcomes of proposed policy strategies, to help better identify and frame situations of transformational change. We use the term “risk-opportunity analysis” to capture the generalised approach, in which conventional economic cost-benefit analysis is a special case. New guiding principles for policy-making during dynamic and transformational change are offered.},

Applying an integrated analytical framework and comparing the results with literature, we identified a number of barriers for novel value-chain development and state seven concrete actions that value-chain actors can take to overcome these barriers. These recommendations can be used by policy makers wishing to facilitate the development of novel biomass value chains in their region; by farmers and industrial actors working to establish new avenues to valorize currently underutilized biomass sources and create additional revenues; and by researchers seeking to disseminate and implement their knowledge about novel technologies as well as socio-economic insights.},

In many countries, including the Netherlands, it has caused environmental controversies. In these controversies, ‘futurity framing’ may open up debates for alternative paradigms such as ‘degrowth,’ which is the pursuing of collective and deliberative, downscaled production of (natural) resources and less consumption for convivial living. Based on a frame analysis, it is demonstrated that opponents and proponents of fracking have envisaged pessimistic energy futures either to promote or devaluate fracking technology. In addition, the results show that dominant technological enthusiasm has enabled the introduction of ‘degrowth technology,’ which are downscaled, decentralized and renewable energy technologies. Degrowth-technology framing may provide a means of access for more radical degrowth thinking in the energy debates. This empirical finding also indicates that the degrowth paradigm could include controversies as entry points for creating support for degrowth thinking.},

  abstract = {Shifting ecosystem disturbance patterns due to climate change (for example, storms, droughts and wildfires) or direct human interference (for example, harvests and nutrient loading) highlight the importance of quantifying and strengthening the resilience of desired ecological regimes. Although existing metrics capture resilience to isolated shocks, gradual parameter changes, and continual noise, quantifying resilience to repeated, discrete disturbance events requires different analytical tools. Here, we introduce a mathematical flow–kick framework that uses dynamical systems tools to quantify resilience to disturbances explicitly in terms of their magnitude and frequency. We identify a boundary between disturbance regimes that cause either escape from, or stabilization within, a basin of attraction. We use the boundary to define resilience metrics tailored to repeated, discrete perturbations. The flow–kick model suggests that the distance-to-threshold resilience metric overestimates resilience in the context of repeated perturbations. It also reveals counterintuitive triggers for regime shifts. These include increasing the periods between disturbance events in proportion to increases to disturbance magnitude, and—in systems with multiple dynamic variables—increasing time periods between disturbances of constant magnitude.},

  abstract = {Reducing tropical deforestation is an international priority, given its impacts on carbon emissions and biodiversity. We examined whether recent forest transitions—a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation—involved a geographic displacement of forest clearing across countries through trade in agricultural and forest products. In most of the seven developing countries that recently experienced a forest transition, displacement of land use abroad accompanied local reforestation. Additional global land-use change embodied in their net wood trade offset 74\% of their total reforested area. Because the reforesting countries continued to export more agricultural goods than they imported, this net displacement offset 22\% of their total reforested area when both agriculture and forestry sectors are included. However, this net displacement increased to 52\% during the last 5 y. These countries thus have contributed to a net global reforestation and/or decrease in the pressure on forests, but this global environmental benefit has been shrinking during recent years. The net decrease in the pressure on forests does not account for differences in their ecological quality. Assessments of the impacts of international policies aimed at reducing global deforestation should integrate international trade in agricultural and forest commodities.},

Drawing on vast data sets and cutting-edge research, he explains the benign and malign forces that make inequality rise and fall within and among nations. He also reveals who has been helped the most by globalization, who has been held back, and what policies might tilt the balance toward economic justice. Global Inequality takes us back hundreds of years, and as far around the world as data allow, to show that inequality moves in cycles, fueled by war and disease, technological disruption, access to education, and redistribution. The recent surge of inequality in the West has been driven by the revolution in technology, just as the Industrial Revolution drove inequality 150 years ago. But even as inequality has soared within nations, it has fallen dramatically among nations, as middle-class incomes in China and India have drawn closer to the stagnating incomes of the middle classes in the developed world. A more open migration policy would reduce global inequality even further. Both American and Chinese inequality seem well entrenched and self-reproducing, though it is difficult to predict if current trends will be derailed by emerging plutocracy, populism, or war. For those who want to understand how we got where we are, where we may be heading, and what policies might help reverse that course, Milanovic's compelling explanation is the ideal place to start."--Provided by publisher},

We show that if 90\% of the new urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to expand by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected natural forests would increase. Our results indicate that expansion of timber plantations for wooden buildings is possible without major repercussions on agricultural production. Strong governance and careful planning are required to ensure a sustainable transition to timber cities even if frontier forests and biodiversity hotspots are protected.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the research field of bioeconomy has experienced significant global growth based on an increasing number of annual publications in the last 10 years. Bioeconomy received a strong political push by European policymakers after the instalment of a “knowledge-based bioeconomy” 15~years ago. While playing an essential role in recent European Union (EU) policies, bioeconomy still lacks a coherent understanding across multiple layers and especially regarding innovation activities. Innovations undoubtedly form one of the basic building blocks of the success of the knowledge-based bioeconomy and its increasing reach, but it must nevertheless be noted that frequently their innovation is not well-understood, and misconceptions prevail. Therefore, this chapter attempts to characterize innovation in bioeconomy. Based on a theoretical discussion of different concepts and aspects of innovation and a literature review at the intersection of bioeconomy and innovation, a catalogue of criteria about what can influence innovation in bioeconomy is proposed. Thus, seven criteria categories are deduced, as well as multiple keywords assigned to each of them. The proclaimed categories are then discussed and ultimately help to identify innovation triggers for bioeconomy. Thus, the article attempts to propose a realistic foundation and theoretical assessment of innovation in bioeconomy to reinforce future discourse on the matter.},

It observes that some of the important achievements of classical technology were in those aspects of technology that were nonphysical in nature: coinage, alphabetization, stenography, and geometry were part of the information-processing sphere rather than the physical production sphere of the economy. The chapter notes that even when their achievements were in the physical sphere, they were mostly in construction and architecture, rather than in mechanical devices. It points out that what technological progress there was in the classical world, especially in Roman times, served the public, rather than the private sector. The chapter further notes that another area in which technical ingenuity improved efficiency in the public sector was in the construction of war machines, and that Greek and Roman military technology provides one of the few areas of successful collaboration between scientists and technology.},

Simultaneous with the growing complexity of technical systems after 1850, however, was a rise in the inventors's ability to solve technological problems. The chapter provides a brief and selective survey regarded as a technological avalanche in the steel and chemical industries. By 1914 the Western world had been growing for many decades, and the gap between it and the rest of the world had become huge.

  abstract = {In a world of supercomputers, genetic engineering, and fiber optics, technological creativity is ever more the key to economic success. But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies—such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution—pass into stagnation? Beginning with a history of technological progress, the book traces the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology; the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions; and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution. The author distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment—which determined their willingness to challenge nature—and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He examines the differences between Europe and China, between classical antiquity and medieval Europe, and between Britain and the rest of Europe during the industrial revolution. The author also examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millennium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs.},

  abstract = {In recent years, economists have revived the specter of slow growth and secular stagnation. From the point of view of economic history, what should we make of such doomster prophecies? As economic historians all know, for 97\% or so of recorded history, the stationary state well-describes the long-run dynamics of the world economy. Growth was slow, intermittent, and reversible. The Industrial Revolution rang in a period of sustained economic growth. Is that growth sustainable? One way to come to grips with that question is to analyze the brakes on economic growth before the Industrial Revolution and examine how they were released. Once these mechanisms are identified, we can look at the economic history of the past few decades and make an assessment of how likely growth is to continue. The answer I give is simple: there is no technological reason for growth in economic welfare to slow down, although institutions may become in some area a serious concern on the sustainability of growth.},

To leverage such ‘socio-technical transitions’ calls for a different, broad mix of research and innovation policies, with particular attention being paid to policy experiments. As TIPs diffuse and gain legitimacy they pose a substantial evaluation challenge: how can we evaluate these policy experiments with a narrow geographical and temporal scope, when the final objective is ambitiously systemic? How can we know whether a specific set of policy experiments is contributing to systemic transformation? Drawing on TIPs principles as developed by and applied in the activities of the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium (TIPC) and on the concept of transformative outcomes, this article develops an approach to the evaluation of TIPs that is operational and adaptable to different contexts.},

  abstract = {The ambition and effectiveness of climate policies will be essential in determining greenhouse gas emissions and, as a consequence, the scale of climate change impacts1,2. However, the socio-politico-technical processes that will determine climate policy and emissions trajectories are treated as exogenous in almost all climate change modelling3,4. Here we identify relevant feedback processes documented across a range of disciplines and connect them in a stylized model of the climate–social system. An analysis of model behaviour reveals the potential for nonlinearities and tipping points that are particularly associated with connections across the individual, community, national and global scales represented. These connections can be decisive for determining policy and emissions outcomes. After partly constraining the model parameter space using observations, we simulate 100,000 possible future policy and emissions trajectories. These fall into 5 clusters with warming in 2100 ranging between 1.8\,°C and 3.6\,°C above the 1880–1910 average. Public perceptions of climate change, the future cost and effectiveness of mitigation technologies, and the responsiveness of political institutions emerge as important in explaining variation in emissions pathways and therefore the constraints on warming over the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {This article studies how innovation reacts to climate change and shapes its economic impacts, focusing on U.S. agriculture. We show in a model that directed innovation can either mitigate or exacerbate climate change’s potential economic damage depending on the substitutability between new technology and favorable climatic conditions. To empirically investigate the technological response to climate change, we measure crop-specific exposure to damaging extreme temperatures and crop-specific innovation embodied in new variety releases and patents. We find that innovation has redirected since the mid-twentieth century toward crops with increasing exposure to extreme temperatures. Moreover, this effect is driven by types of agricultural technology most related to environmental adaptation. We next show that U.S. counties’ exposure to induced innovation significantly dampens the local economic damage from extreme temperatures. Combining these estimates with the model, we find that directed innovation has offset 20\% of potential losses in U.S. agricultural land value due to damaging climate trends since 1960 and that innovation could offset 13\% of projected damage by 2100. These findings highlight the vital importance, but incomplete effectiveness, of endogenous technological change as a source of adaptation to climate change.},

At the same time, however, critique against it is getting increasingly louder. This paper articulates a critical analysis of Climate Engineering technologies from a point of view situated within the degrowth discourse. In the first part two approaches discussed within the degrowth debate are presented: the concept of viability based on a biophysical perspective and the concept of conviviality based on a socio-cultural approach. In a second step formalized arguments from the point of view of applied ethics are articulated and applied to three Climate Engineering Technologies: Sulfate Aerosol Injection, Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, and Afforestation. In a third step, an extended version of the trade-off argument about mitigation versus Climate Engineering solution is discussed from a degrowth perspective: accordingly, within the current dominant growth paradigm, climate engineering technologies might lead to reduced mitigation efforts. The paper follows the argumentative turn in applied ethics and displays a formalization of arguments that can help clarify decision-making and identify the different dimensions at stake. The paper articulates arguments against the deployment of CE technologies and advances a new version of the trade-off-argument based on a degrowth perspective. From the point of view of a degrowth-based critique of technology, the only type of Climate Engineering Technology ethically acceptable would be afforestation under specific conditions.},

Firms and other actors collaborate in formal networks not only to generate new knowledge but also to strategically create and shape supportive system resources such as technology specific R\&D programs. This paper takes a closer look at the resources, which are developed and deployed by networks to facilitate the building up of a TIS. Networks rely not only on the organizational resources of their members but also on new resources developed at the network level including network governance structures, trust among network members, a common understanding of the strategic goals or a good reputation of the network. Our analysis shows that the capacity of networks to fulfill different tasks of system building especially depends on the network resources they are able to establish. With the differentiation of organizational, network and system resources we introduce a conceptual framework, which makes three important contributions. It highlights the strategic nature of (innovation) system building; it allows us comparing the contribution of different actors and formal networks in this regard; and it improves our understanding of how firm and system level processes are intertwined.},

Although 60\% of the global working population make their living in the informal sector mostly in low-and middle income countries, the potential for SBMs has rarely been analyzed for this category. This study explores the SBMs of informal charcoal-producing enterprises in coastal Kenya. It describes key business-model components: value proposition, value creation and delivery, and economic value capture. Impact and dependency on sustainability-related indicators were also studied. Data were obtained through individual interviews, focus-group discussions, and workshops for charcoal producers and other relevant stakeholders. Findings demonstrated that charcoal enterprises, despite their informal status, adopt elaborate business models. The incomes positively affect several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing, if not eradicating, poverty and supporting basic livelihood needs. Examples of negative impacts on some SDG include the activity’s contribution to forest degradation. Feedback impacts, where SDG status influence the informal enterprises’ opportunities were also identified. The SBM model contributes to the development of a balanced sustainability transition of the charcoal sector. We suggest further analyses of the role of informal enterprises in the bioenergy sector for sustainable development and how their SBMs could be improved.},

One appeal of focus groups is that in some ways they seem like everyday talk, but their effectiveness depends on a tension between the moderator's constraints and participants' interaction. The moderator introduces and defines topics, but participants can shift, close, and interpret them. The moderator elicits disagreement in a way specific to focus groups, but participants manage their disagreement. Thus we see not simple control by the moderator, but a complex collaborative project operating under the shared assumption that the purpose of the discussion is to display opinions to the moderator. These findings extend the analysis of conversation in institutional settings and contribute to a methodological critique of the reification of attitudes and opinions in some social science research.

The dominant understanding in contemporary sustainability discourse is that concerns about ‘planet, people and profit’ must be balanced against each other if development is to be sustainable. However, there is growing evidence that only a partial ‘decoupling’ between growth and negative environmental impacts is achievable. Policies and planning necessary for a transition to equitable environmental sustainability are often deemed unrealistic and impossible. This impossibility of the strongly desirable calls for transformative societal change. Radical innovation is needed to outline a new, democratic social order that supports ecological responsibility and social justice. Radical innovation is also needed to explore strategies and pathways for transitioning to societal conditions that are conducive to sustainability.},

This study explores the transition of Finnish FBS firms to new business models, with a focus on the organizational resources and capabilities needed for transition. It also identifies the important elements in the business environment and the role of innovations in this process. The study uses thematic interviews with managers from various FBS firms and companies from interfacing sectors, all of which have operations in Finland. Despite the differences between firms, the study finds many common drivers and resources that FBS companies highlight as significant in the transition. The study results indicate that intangible and human resources are essential for the transition. An innovative, agile, flexible and encouraging organizational culture is a crucial resource. The culture should be supported by non-hierarchical top management and inspiring employees (so-called power people). Communication and marketing skills, and innovations developed by teams with diverse knowledge are essential. To successfully manage the transition, companies need a deep understanding of what the markets and society require, and they must develop long-term competiveness through future-oriented strategic thinking. Pursuing sustainability and innovativeness in internal as well as external organizational environment are essential factors. The study presents insights for the researcher community and many societal actors as well as recommendations for the FBS companies to facilitate the transition to new circular bioeconomy businesses. It also contributes to the resource-based perspectives literature, particularly the dynamic capabilities approach.},

The data produced by these experiments are often rich and multimodal, yet at the same time they may contain substantial measurement error1–7. Accurate analysis and understanding of networked systems requires a way of estimating the true structure of networks from such rich but noisy data8–15. Here we describe a technique that allows us to make optimal estimates of network structure from complex data in arbitrary formats, including cases where there may be measurements of many different types, repeated observations, contradictory observations, annotations or metadata, or missing data. We give example applications to two different social networks, one derived from face-to-face interactions and one from self-reported friendships.},

  abstract = {Private forests are widespread in Europe providing a range of ecosystem services of significant value to society, and there are calls for novel policies to enhance their provision and to face the challenges of environmental changes. Such policies need to acknowledge the importance of private forests, and importantly they need to be based on a deep understanding of how property rights held by private forest owners vary across Europe. We collected and analysed data on the content of property rights based on formal legal requirements existing in 31 European jurisdictions. To allow a comparison across jurisdictions, we constructed an original Property Rights Index for Forestry encompassing five rights domains (access, withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation). We documented substantial variation of the private forest owners’ rights, and notably to i) make decisions in operational management and the formulation of management goals, ii) withdraw timber resources from their forest, and iii) exclude others from the use of forest resources. We identified broad relations between the scope for decision making of private forest owners and jurisdictions’ former socio-political background and geographical distribution. The variation in the content of property rights has implications for the implementation of international environmental policies, and stresses the need for tailored policy instruments, when addressing European society’s rural development, the bioeconomy, climate change mitigation measures and nature protection strategies.},

  abstract = {In the last two decades, attention on forests and ownership rights has increased in different domains of international policy, particularly in relation to achieving the global sustainable development goals. This paper looks at the changes in forest-specific legislation applicable to regular productive forests, across 28 European countries. We compare the legal framework applicable in the mid-1990s with that applicable in 2015, using the Property Rights Index in Forestry (PRIF) to measure changes across time and space. The paper shows that forest owners in most western European countries already had high decision-making power in the mid-1990s, following deregulation trends from the 1980s; and for the next two decades, distribution of rights remained largely stable. For these countries, the content and direction of changes indicate that the main pressure on forest-focused legislation comes from environmental discourses (e.g. biodiversity and climate change policies). In contrast, former socialist countries in the mid-1990s gave lower decision-making powers to forest owners than in any of the Western Europe countries; over the next 20 years these show remarkable changes in management, exclusion and withdrawal rights. As a result of these changes, there is no longer a clear line between western and former socialist countries with respect to the national governance systems used to address private forest ownership. Nevertheless, with the exception of Baltic countries which have moved towards the western forest governance system, most of the former socialist countries still maintain a state-centred approach in private forest management. Overall, most of the changes we identified in the last two decades across Europe were recorded in the categories of management rights and exclusion rights. These changes reflect the general trend in European forest policies to expand and reinforce the landowners’ individual rights, while preserving minimal rights for other categories of forest users; and to promote the use of financial instruments when targeting policy goals related to the environmental discourse.},

They vividly demonstrate that, contrary to current macroeconomic preoccupations, continued growth on a planet of finite resources cannot be physically or economically sustained and is morally undesirable.Among the issues addressed are population growth, resource use, pollution, theology (east and west), energy, and economic growth. Their common theme is the notion, popular with classical economists from Malthus to Mill, that an economic stationary state is more healthful to life on earth than unlimited growth.

I estimated a vector autoregression for data on fertility, mortality and real wages over the period 1541–1840 applying a well-known identification strategy broadly used in macroeconomics. The results show that endogenous adjustment of population to real wages functioned as Malthus assumed only until the seventeenth century: positive checks disappeared during the seventeenth century and preventive checks disappeared before 1740. This implies that the endogenous adjustment of population levels to changes in real wages — one of the cornerstones of the Malthusian model — did not work during an important part of the period usually considered within the ‘Malthusian regime’.},

Papers included in this Issue blend diverse theoretical positions into a coherent explanation of spatial variability, case and context specificity of social innovation, encompassing its empirical diversity, complexities and multiple dimensions. The suggested articles improve existing knowledge of determinants of success seeking to answer the question of how to support enhanced governance and social innovations, addressing multiplicity and priorities of social needs, and new social relationships and collaborations. We also provide innovative solutions and sustainable forestry considerations, ideas potentially useful for policy makers and practice communities of different levels, having ultimate aims of increasing the well-being of forest-dependent communities and building the resilience to changes taking place in remote rural areas of Europe and beyond.},

  abstract = {With an increasing fraction of the world’s forests being intensively managed for meeting humanity’s need for wood, fiber and ecosystem services, quantitative understanding of the functional changes in these ecosystems in comparison with natural forests is needed. In particular, the role of managed forests as long-term carbon (C) sinks and for mitigating climate change require a detailed assessment of their carbon cycle on different temporal scales. In the current review we assess available data on the structure and function of the world’s forests, explore the main differences in the C exchange between managed and unmanaged stands, and explore potential physiological mechanisms behind both observed and expected changes. Two global databases that include classification for management indicate that managed forests are about 50years younger, include 25\% more coniferous stands, and have about 50\% lower C stocks than unmanaged forests. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and total net primary productivity (NPP) are the similar, but relatively more of the assimilated carbon is allocated to aboveground pools in managed than in unmanaged forests, whereas allocation to fine roots and rhizosymbionts is lower. This shift in allocation patterns is promoted by increasing plant size, and by increased nutrient availability. Long-term carbon sequestration potential in soils is assessed through the ratio of heterotrophic respiration to total detritus production, which indicates that (i) the forest soils may be losing more carbon on an annual basis than they regain in detritus, and (ii) the deficit appears to be greater in managed forests. While climate change and management factors (esp. fertilization) both contribute to greater carbon accumulation potential in the soil, the harvest-related increase in decomposition affects the C budget over the entire harvest cycle. Although the findings do not preclude the use of forests for climate mitigation, maximizing merchantable productivity may have significant carbon costs for the soil pool. We conclude that optimal management strategies for maximizing multiple benefits from ecosystem services require better understanding of the dynamics of belowground allocation, carbohydrate availability, heterotrophic respiration, and carbon stabilization in the soil.},

Whereas in BNW Russia, the logging frontier could be kept moving into unharvested regions, N Sweden earlier had to develop solutions where large-scale logging had already taken place. In 1950-1990, Swedish strategies included rationing of old forest, effective regeneration and also precommercial and commercial thinning. Supporting means were legislation, government-funded subsidies and collaboration among enterprises, researchers and political leaders. BNW Russia is currently facing similar challenges and N Swedish experiences should be analysed and used where applicable. In N Sweden, a too low proportion of representative productive old forests remains, but in the last decades, N Swedish forests exempted from economic use have been significantly increased. Ongoing discussions of also defining areas with more intensive forest management would lead to a zoning, bearing some resemblance to the Russian system, in use since 1943. Russian experience should, therefore, be of interest to Swedish forest policy-makers. Both countries have problems with rural social issues. Both can benefit from collaboration on these aspects of sustainable forest management.},

Finally, we contribute to the sustainability transitions literature by exploring the dynamics of emerging TISs for industrial decarbonisation.},

Climate for innovation and innovation strategy as drivers for success in the wood industry: moderation effects of firm size, industry sector, and country of operation. Silva Fennica 45(3): 415–430. This study examines the relationships between firm financial performance and a) the climate for innovation and b) innovation strategy in the wood products industry. The focus is on the moderator effects of firm size, country of operation, and industry sector. Using a sample of 460 responses from chief executive officers and top managers of Norwegian and US firms, we conducted a regression analysis to probe for interaction effects. The sample included primary and secondary manufacturers of various sizes. Consistent with previous studies, we found a positive impact for both a climate for innovation and an innovation strategy on firm performance. In terms of moderation, only one interaction was found to be significant, representing a moderator effect of industry × size on the climate-performance relationship. Further testing showed that secondary, large manufacturers exhibited a weaker, yet still positive, relationship between climate for innovation and performance. This low level of significant interactions suggests stability of the relationship among the main factors depicted in the model, with important implications for managers and future research. These findings indicate that a positive climate for innovation and a management committed to innovation through an innovation strategy have a positive effect on the bottom line of wood products firms. This effect holds true regardless of industry, size, or country, so most firms can benefit from the implementation of these pro-innovation practices.},

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence                            One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts               et al.               describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.aac4716                        ,              A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.                                         RATIONALE               There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.                                         RESULTS                                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and                 P                 values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (                 P                 {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.                                                        CONCLUSION                                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original                 P                 value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.                              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.                                                   Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).                   Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.                                                                         ,              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects.

This framing masks the potential for economic growth in nonindustrial societies, but there is growing evidence for episodes where the material conditions of life did improve in the preindustrial past. Here, we explore a potential mechanism behind these improvements. We use settlement scaling theory to distinguish agglomeration-driven from technology-driven growth, and then we apply this framework to archaeological evidence from the Pre-Hispanic Northern Rio Grande Pueblos of New Mexico, USA. Results suggest that agglomeration-driven or “Smithian” growth was the dominant factor behind improvements in the material conditions of life over time in this society. We also summarize evidence that this growth took place in the context of a stable regional population, declining levels of inequality, and increasingly inclusive social institutions.},

In subarctic ecosystems, primarily inhabited by native peoples, deforestation is generally considered to be mainly associated with the industrial period. Here we examined mechanisms underlying deforestation a thousand years ago in a high-mountain valley with settlement artifacts located in subarctic Scandinavia. Using the Heureka Forestry Decision Support System, we modeled pre-settlement conditions and effects of tree cutting on forest cover. To examine lack of regeneration and present nutrient status, we analyzed soil nitrogen. We found that tree cutting could have deforested the valley within some hundred years. Overexploitation left the soil depleted beyond the capacity of re-establishment of trees. We suggest that pre-historical deforestation has occurred also in subarctic ecosystems and that ecosystem boundaries were especially vulnerable to this process. This study improves our understanding of mechanisms behind human-induced ecosystem transformations and tree-line changes, and of the concept of wilderness in the Scandinavian mountain range.},

  abstract = {Safely achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement requires a worldwide transformation to carbon-neutral societies within the next 30 y. Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth’s climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks). Our research reveals important areas of focus for larger-scale empirical and modeling efforts to better understand the potentials of harnessing social tipping dynamics for climate change mitigation.},

The framework comprises three critical processes: enabling exchange practices, proving the system and constructing the narrative. Individually, these processes generate different kinds of value – traded, demonstrated and expected value – and the value output from each process serves as input to the other two processes. Hence the value streams link the processes together. We illustrate the framework by analyzing market-shaping processes for biogas in Sweden. The case analysis shows how public and private actors have engaged in a multitude of activities that have built up the market-shaping processes. The analysis highlights the recursive nature of sustainable market-shaping, showing how key actors must repeatedly respond to tensions resulting from growth and aspirations of growth.},

A detailed examination of the harvest data and the National Forest Accounting Plans of the countries within this region reveals that the countries have calculated their FRLs based on different modelling approaches and that the quality of data used has not always been sound. The process of preparing the FRLs has most likely contributed to improvements in this regard, but obtaining comparable and reliable data on the harvest levels compatible to the FRLs still represents a challenge. We estimated that within EU~+~UK~+~N, the aggregated FRL-compatible harvests would be 597~Mm3/a over bark for the first compliance period 2021–2025 and 619~Mm3/a over bark for the second compliance period 2026–2030. Comparing the FRL-compatible harvest levels to future harvests projected by linear trend and by global forest sector modelling, we found that some of the countries seemed likely to reach their FRLs without needing to deviate from their market-driven harvests, whereas the region as a whole would not reach its FRLs without measures taken to decrease the harvests. If harvests would be reduced from the market driven levels, it would cause harvest leakage to the other countries. We found that for each 1~m3 of roundwood harvest reduction in EU~+~UK~+~N in year 2030, roundwood harvest would increase by some 0.64~m3 in rest of the world, giving a leakage rate of 64\%. In addition to harvest leakage, there would also be some leakage of forest industry production. The leakage effect strongly weakens the effectiveness and cost efficiency of reducing harvests in the EU as a policy means for climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {The discovery of massive deposits of precious metals in America during the early modern period caused an exogenous monetary injection to Europe’s money supply. I use this episode to identify the causal effects of money. Using a panel of six European countries, I find that monetary expansions had a material impact on real economic activity. The magnitudes are substantial and persist for a long time: an exogenous 10\% increase in the production of precious metals in America measured relative to the European stock leads to a front-loaded response of output and, to a lesser extent, inflation. There was a positive hump-shaped response of real GDP, with a cumulative increase up to 0.9\% six to nine years later. The evidence suggests that this is because prices responded to monetary injections with considerable lags.},

  abstract = {Transitioning to a bioeconomy involves multiple actors, institutions, and sectors. Transition stakeholder domains work independently with each being guided by their own governance/policy-regimes. However, domains are interdependent, fostering competition and alliance forming. This makes transitions inherently political with lobbying influencing trajectories. With food production, bioeconomy transitions trend towards appropriationism (technologies contribute to existing supply chains) or substitutionism (replacement of end-products with facsimiles), which is disruptive to existing interests. Given bioeconomic stakeholder complexity and lobbying, understanding political influence on bioeconomy transitions is critical. This futures study employs systems engineering approaches and SPADE methodology to examine the issue of substitutionism within the food sector of the bioeconomy. We applied causal mapping of political structures in bioeconomic transitions based on the case of renewable energy political lobbying, identifying three key political feedback structures influencing a substitutionism bioeconomy transition: Technological Lock-in Balancing Loop; Original Lobbying Reinforcing Loop and Substitution Lobbying Reinforcing Loop. The influence of these structures on policy/regulation are then discussed.},

  abstract = {Our research focuses on the cross-pollination of the discourses of innovation and (post)development in the Global South. We suggest that the buzzword innovation is progressively infiltrating the lexicon and situated practices of development. Within this a hegemonic framing of innovation is emerging that leverages the language of inclusion to promote connection to, and participation in, the global free market economy. This, we hypothesise is closing down a broader debate concerning the goals and roles of innovation and technology in the so called developing world. At the same time, our research suggests that this emerging hegemony is contested, presenting as alternative, minority framings with different normative underpinnings for technology and innovation that challenge the pro-growth and market-led dominant paradigm. We present the results of one of these through a qualitative in-depth case study conducted in the Indian state of Kerala. The case provides interesting insights for the degrowth community in two regards. First it shows a concrete example of an alternative framing of technology underpinned by a set of normative principles connected to those of degrowth. Second, the case shows that alternative technological paradigms based on principles aligned with those of degrowth are not only possible, but can and do co-exist with the hegemonic paradigm.},

It raises a number of points that indicate the potential of system dynamics for transition research in terms of methodology and case study research, the behavioural aspects of transitions, and particular subject areas that lie at the organizational field level: technology platforms, business models and organizational change.},

Academic literature conceptualizes attention to societal challenges as the directionality of innovation systems. Directionality requires an opening-up to include actors from the demand side of innovation processes. But this opening-up raises questions about who determines the direction of transformative change. In Sweden, transformative innovation policy has taken the form of strategic innovation programmes. A case study of one programme, Internet of Things Sweden, provides the opportunity to examine how directionality is implemented. The analysis shows how a focus on demand articulation made it possible to avoid making decisions about the direction of change. Innovation projects that mimicked public procurement limited the potential for radical transformative change. However, policy layering was an enabling factor at the urban level, where regional innovation actors facilitated the participation of urban infrastructure companies.},

Several areas of struggle come into view: the politics of novelty, uptake, dismantling, stability, and interplay across regimes. This leads to a view of institutional transformation as an unfolding trajectory ‘in-the-making’, characterized by emergent path creation. Moreover, it enables new bridges from transitions thinking to broader political and policy sciences which also increasingly puzzle over how major societal change may be realized in contemporary society.},

Any experiment that searches for advantageous mutants will lose many of them due to random drift. It is therefore of great interest to find population structures that improve the odds of advantageous mutants. Such structures are called amplifiers of natural selection: they increase the probability that advantageous mutants are selected. Arbitrarily strong amplifiers guarantee the selection of advantageous mutants, even for very small fitness advantage. Despite intensive research over the past decade, arbitrarily strong amplifiers have remained rare. Here we show how to construct a large variety of them. Our amplifiers are so simple that they could be useful in biotechnology, when optimizing biological molecules, or as a diagnostic tool, when searching for faster dividing cells or viruses. They could also occur in natural population structures.},

They require bold leadership and innovative policy, both in response to environmental risk and to navigate political, technical and socio-economic conditions. This paper integrates complex adaptive systems and risk society theory to inform a discussion on regional socio-technical transitions. South Australia is forging its own adaptive pathway, and in doing so, is leading energy transitions in Australia. Utilising the complex adaptive cycle to frame the state's renewable energy transition, the path can be seen to be evolving from a simple first modernity to a multi-dimensional second modernity. Socio-technical transitions are partly a by-product of responses to risk. While there is no single map for navigating societal transitions, this paper proposes that risk, in the context of risk society theory, is an important guiding dimension for understanding transformational change in socio-technical systems.},

  abstract = {The global extraction of minerals is commonly located in areas populated by indigenous people; and while conflicts between multinational corporations and local activists and indigenous people are widespread today, the understanding of their dynamics are lacking. The Swedish government’s encouragement to an expanding mining industry has caused resistance due to environmental and social implications, particularly its effect on Sámi reindeer husbandry. The resistance to a mine in Gállok is based on the belief that the right to decide about land use historically falls on the Sámi people, and the right to affect land use is detrimental for the survival of Sámi culture and reindeer husbandry. Although the conflict may be perceived as concerning access to natural resources, we argue that the perceived environmental conflict can be viewed as part of a larger struggle over social status and recognition. Data have been collected using qualitative methods such as observations, interviews and documents. The subsequent analysis relies on a meta-theoretical framework of justice as recognition using a typology of relations of power. Our findings suggest that relations of power constitute different categories of social actors. Stakeholders like the Sámi population are subordinated to more dominant stakeholders such as the government, the company and media, who have ‘more’ power or ‘different’ kinds of power ‘over’ others. Through these asymmetric power relations, historical state-Sámi relations are continuously reproduced within prevailing institutions, and also in this mining conflict. Interviewees from business and the municipality testified to the discourses driven by a neoliberal and profit-focused worldview. Challenging the neoliberal discourse, other stakeholders, namely civil society and Sámi, expressed an alternative discourse based on a local, traditional, cultural, environmental and anti-neoliberal worldview.},

  abstract = {We submit that the safe operating space of the planetary boundary of novel entities is exceeded since annual production and releases are increasing at a pace that outstrips the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies’ ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.},

  abstract = {The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the time average and the expectation value of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models. The conditions for validity are restrictive, even more so for non-equilibrium systems. Economics typically deals with systems far from equilibrium — specifically with models of growth. It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the prevailing formulations of economic theory — expected utility theory and its descendants — make an indiscriminate assumption of ergodicity. This is largely because foundational concepts to do with risk and randomness originated in seventeenth-century economics, predating by some 200 years the concept of ergodicity, which arose in nineteenth-century physics. In this Perspective, I argue that by carefully addressing the question of ergodicity, many puzzles besetting the current economic formalism are resolved in a natural and empirically testable way.},

  abstract = {When two entities cooperate by sharing resources, one relinquishes something of value to the other. This apparent altruism is frequently observed in nature. Why? Classical treatments assume circumstances where combining resources creates an immediate benefit, e.g. through complementarity or thresholds. Here we ask whether cooperation is predictable without such circumstances. We study a model in which resources self-multiply with fluctuations, a null model of a range of phenomena from viral spread to financial investment. Two fundamental growth rates exist: the ensemble-average growth rate, achieved by the average resources of a large population; and the time-average growth rate, achieved by individual resources over a long time. As a consequence of non-ergodicity, the latter is lower than the former by a term which depends on fluctuation size. Repeated pooling and sharing of resources reduces the effective size of fluctuations and increases the time-average growth rate, which approaches the ensemble-average growth rate in the many-cooperator limit. Therefore, cooperation is advantageous in our model for the simple reason that those who do it grow faster than those who do not. We offer this as a candidate explanation for observed cooperation in rudimentary environments, and as a behavioural baseline for cooperation more generally. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Emergent phenomena in complex physical and socio-technical systems: from cells to societies’.},

The common understanding is that NIS are the primary source of technological knowledge acquisition for innovating firms, but the opening of economies, the globalization of innovation networks, and the rapid internationalization of innovative firms challenge this view -- especially with respect to small open economies in transition. We applied PLS-SEM to data from 131 R\&D intensive firms responding to a survey investigating the mediating role of international networks for technological learning within Lithuania's NIS. The findings demonstrate a full mediating role of global innovation system networks in facilitating technological learning within NIS, partially contradicting the prevailing understanding of the primary importance of NIS based networks for firm learning. Technological learning of firms, and thus the upgrading of the NIS they are embedded in, relies more on international networks than previously assumed. These results call for a more careful design and facilitation of technological learning networks, recognizing global networks as a complementary and necessary component in NIS upgrading. This study contributes to the literature of technological learning within national innovation systems, with a special focus on R\&D intensive firms leading the technological upgrading of a country's NIS.},

  abstract = {The degree to which an environment-human relationship and system is vulnerable determines sustainability outcomes. The greater the vulnerability occurring at a specified spatial-temporal scale, the greater the potential detrimental influence and impact upon sustainability. The relationship between vulnerability and sustainability has not been adequately holistically and quantitatively examined thus far. This represents a potential fundamental knowledge gap in achieving co-evolutionary pathways. Therefore, this paper conducts a holistic quantitative sustainability dynamic assessment of the United Kingdom (UK) for the period 1995–2018, from a vulnerability perspective. This is conducted by the application of the Sustainability Dynamics Framework. The results indicate that the UK has S-values within the range [−0.274~≤~S(t)~≤~−0.253] over the specified period, consistent with weak unsustainability occurring. This is due to excessive post-optimum population levels requiring significant economic growth to fulfil societal needs, and thus resulting in significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, the UK is significantly vulnerable to climate change. Furthermore, there is distinct evidence of the dynamic changes occurring to the UK environment-human system and relationship over the specified period, consistent with the Great Acceleration occurring. The results overall indicate that the UK's current co-evolutionary pathway presents the potential perilous and realistic risk of an environment-human system crisis or collapse occurring. The UK has to either choose between continuing upon its current trajectory pathway and the resultant consequences; or choosing to restoring the co-evolutionary relationship with the environment.},

The emergent field of ‘multilayer networks’ provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological systems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically allows one to differentiate and model ‘intralayer’ and ‘interlayer’ connectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be adapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional, heterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer networks based on a review of previous, related approaches; illustrate their application and potential with analyses of existing data; and discuss limitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer network theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to investigate ecological complexity and provide new theoretical and empirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.},

Grounded in the degrowth literature, this paper asks how the European Union measures progress, economic development and the relevance of environmental protection. Specifically, this article aims at tracing degrowth elements in the Horizon 2020 program, i.e. the research and innovation agenda and funding scheme of the Union, which constitutes one of the European Union’s major instruments for steering economic development. Employing a frame analysis this research detects a minor agenda pointing beyond conventional growth perspectives; however, conventional growth remains the central focus in the Horizon 2020 framework even where “green growth” measures are discussed. This research shows that this pattern is especially evident in technology policy and schemes related to information and communication technology in particular. The article reflects on the rationales for why the European Union pursues only a minor degrowth agenda. It points to a neoliberal meta-frame and to the effects of path dependency related to the Union’s common market conceived of as a driver of prosperity. Finally, the paper identifies comparative policy analysis as a promising area for deeper integration of degrowth theory in political science research.},

Massive tree planting is thus sometimes portrayed as a panacea to mitigate climate change and related impacts. Recent controversies about the potential benefits and drawbacks of forestation have centered on the carbon storage potential of forests and the local or global thermodynamic impacts. Here we discuss how global-scale forestation and deforestation change the Earth’s energy balance, thereby affect the global atmospheric circulation and even have profound effects on the ocean circulation. We perform multicentury coupled climate model simulations in which preindustrial vegetation cover is either completely forested or deforested and carbon dioxide mixing ratio is kept constant. We show that global-scale forestation leads to a weakening and poleward shift of the Northern mid-latitude circulation, slows-down the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and affects the strength of the Hadley cell, whereas deforestation leads to reversed changes. Consequently, both land surface changes substantially affect regional precipitation, temperature, clouds, and surface wind patterns across the globe. The design process of large-scale forestation projects thus needs to take into account global circulation adjustments and their influence on remote climate.},

It reveals that the endgame of the “school choice” enterprise for libertarians was not then—and is not now--to enhance education for all children; it was a strategy, ultimately, to offload the full cost of schooling onto parents as part of a larger quest to privatize public services and resources. Based on extensive original archival research, this paper shows how Friedman’s case for vouchers to promote “educational freedom” buttressed the case of Southern advocates of the policy of massive resistance to Brown v. Board of Education. His approach—supported by many other Mont Pelerin Society members and leading libertarians of the day --taught white supremacists a more sophisticated, and for more than a decade, court-proof way to preserve Jim Crow. All they had to do was cease overt focus on race and instead deploy a neoliberal language of personal liberty, government failure and the need for market competition in the provision of public education.},

It allows managers and decision makers to anticipate trends for an accurate forecast and effective foresight. Researchers and practitioners are taking advantage of the rapid growth of the publicly accessible sources to map technological domains. Among these sources, patents are the widest technical open access database used in the literature and in practice. Nowadays, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques enable new methods for the analysis of patent texts. Among these techniques, in this paper we explore the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the purpose to identify the technologies mentioned in patents' text. We compare three different NER methods, gazetteer-based, rule-based and deep learning-based (e.g. BERT), measuring their performances in terms of precision, recall and computational time. We test the approaches on 1600 patents from four assorted IPC classes as case studies. Our NER systems collected over 4500 fine-grained technologies, achieving the best results thanks to the combination of the three methodologies. The proposed method overcomes the literature thanks to the ability to filter generic technological terms. Our study delineates a valid technology identification tool that can be integrated in any text analysis pipeline to support academics and companies in investigating a technological domain.},

Hitherto, the risks posed by this technology have been framed as a technical rather than a political challenge. With the help of a thought experiment, this paper explores the environmental and social implications of superintelligence emerging in an economy shaped by neoliberal policies. It is argued that such policies exacerbate the risk of extremely adverse impacts. The experiment also serves to highlight some serious flaws in the pursuit of economic efficiency and growth per se, and suggests that the challenge of superintelligence cannot be separated from the other major environmental and social challenges, demanding a fundamental transformation along the lines of degrowth. Crucially, with machines outperforming them in their functions, there is little reason to expect economic elites to be exempt from the threats that superintelligence would pose in a neoliberal context, which opens a door to overcoming vested interests that stand in the way of social change toward sustainability and equity.},

It does therefore have the potential of becoming an influential global discourse. Its role is however so far unclear. The general assumption that guides this paper is that discourses, resulting ideas and arguments are generally said to have performative power. They shape actors' views, influence their behaviour, impact on their beliefs and interests and can cause institutional change in a given society. Thus, the aim of this paper is twofold: first, it aims to analyse whether the ideas used in a bioeconomy discourse differs from those in other global meta-discourses of the last decades affecting forest discourses, such as the ecological modernization discourse or the sustainable development discourse. Second, this paper aims to analyse whether and how the bioeconomy discourse has started (or not) to reshape or overshadow the “classical” forest discourses, such as sustainable forest management, forest biodiversity or forest and climate change.},

First, we conduct a literature review on the most well-known rationale behind the EKC prevalence and discuss the key components of the research design when estimating the EKC. Second, we bring together the most influential empirical papers published in the last decade, which focus on EKC estimation in developing and transition economies. Overall, succeeding to curtail some of the deficiencies suggested by theoretical contributions, the recent empirical studies might indicate a certain consensus regarding pollution-growth nexus, and EKC validity. On the one hand, reinforcing the EKC nature, several studies reveal a long-run relationship between indicators. On the other hand, according to income coefficients signs, the traditional bell-shape pattern seems to be at work for some developing and transition economies. However, in some cases, the estimated turning point lies outside the income sample range, calling into question not only the true pattern between pollution and growth but also the identification of EKC. Taken collectively, both the theoretical foundations and empirical evidence, could contribute to a better understanding of the pollution-growth nexus in the EKC context, and suggest some useful insights regarding the future works on the subject as well as the crucial policy implications in this group of countries.},

It is promoted as a promising means of making economic processes and products more sustainable, with expected contributions to a range of policy aims. However, by increasing the demand for bio-based resources, bioeconomy concepts also impose additional pressures on ecosystems. In limiting these pressures, innovations regarding the use of biogenic and non-biogenic renewable resources play an important role. A well-developed innovation system for the bioeconomy must enable immature renewable resource-based technologies to progress down the learning curve, to eventually reach competitiveness with fossil resource substitutes; second, innovation efforts need to be steered towards bioeconomy pathways with favourable environmental characteristics; third, innovations need to be socially acceptable. Focussing on the case of the German wood-based bioeconomy, this contribution examines the role that policies can play in shaping such an innovation system. First, we review what policy contributions are considered as key for strengthening transition-oriented innovation systems in the innovation economics and innovation systems literature. We then apply these insights to the analysis of the case study’s innovation system, to identify systemic weaknesses and discuss policy implications. Notably, the transition towards a bioeconomy is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty and complexity, making the design of demand-pull policies particularly challenging. We conclude with policy recommendations for strengthening a sustainability-oriented innovation system for the German wood-based bioeconomy.},

With a view of identifying the genesis and theoretical foundations of this conception, this paper reviews and discusses relevant historical sustainability literature. From this we find that there is no single point of origin of this three-pillar conception, but rather a gradual emergence from various critiques in the early academic literature of the economic status quo from both social and ecological perspectives on the one hand, and the quest to reconcile economic growth as a solution to social and ecological problems on the part of the United Nations on the other. The popular three circles diagram appears to have been first presented by Barbier (Environ Conserv 14:101, doi: 10.1017/s0376892900011449, 1987), albeit purposed towards developing nations with foci which differ from modern interpretations. The conceptualisation of three pillars seems to predate this, however. Nowhere have we found a theoretically rigorous description of the three pillars. This is thought to be in part due to the nature of the sustainability discourse arising from broadly different schools of thought historically. The absence of such a theoretically solid conception frustrates approaches towards a theoretically rigorous operationalisation of ‘sustainability’.},

We argue that the knowledge-based bioeconomy and digitalization are two promising technological approaches which require to be thought together in order to contribute to the transformation and to trigger the required technological dynamics. However, such a broad transformative process requires a participation of all societal stakeholders. Innovation systems in principle offer a framework for policy designs supporting the transformation, but they need to be extended to include the direction towards overcoming the lock-in in oil-based economic activities and mass consumption. For this purpose, we introduce the idea of a Dedicated Innovation System, which takes care of potential inertia due to the interest of established (oil-based) industries and consider the economic opportunities raised by social and responsible innovation. The transformation process will likely compensate for decreasing jobs in traditional sectors, which are increasingly replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. The knowledge-based digital bioeconomy is likely to generate the emergence of new sectors with new employment opportunities, e.g. in periphery regions or in the emerging sharing-economy sector.},

  abstract = {With its update of the Bioeconomy Strategy and the Green Deal, the European Commission committed itself to a transformation towards a sustainable and climate-neutral European Union. This process is characterised with an enormous complexity, which policymaking needs to acknowledge for designing transition pathways. Modelling can support policymaking in dealing with uncertainty and complexity. This article reviews emerging and new developments and approaches to model the development of the bioeconomy. We focused our review on how bioeconomy modelling addresses key enabling factors related to (i) climate change, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) circular use of biomass, (iv) consumer behaviour related to biomass and bioproducts use, and (v) innovation and technological change. We find that existing modelling frameworks offer large possibilities for extensions and considerations for analysing short-run impacts related to climate change and circularity, and to lesser degree for biodiversity, and we identify possibilities for developing further the existing bioeconomy models. However, addressing key processes related to societal and technological changes is more challenging with existing/conventional modelling approaches, as they specifically relate to how innovations transform economic structures and how consumers learn and change their preferences and what kind of dynamics are to be expected. We indicate how emerging modelling techniques such as Agent-Based Modelling could improve and complement existing bioeconomy modelling efforts by allowing for the consideration of structural change and, more generally, transformation of the economic metabolism. This modelling approach eclecticism asks for a better description of modelling targets, a sound reflection on the meaning of time horizons and a closer cooperation between the different research communities. Furthermore, it will benefit from the developments in big data and artificial intelligence from which we expect valuable guideposts for designing future modelling strategies.},

In traditional text classification, the classes appeared in testing must have been seen in training. However, in many applications, this is not the case because in testing, we may see unexpected instances that are not from any of the training classes. In this paper, we propose a significantly more effective approach that converts the original problem to a pair-wise matching problem and then outputs how probable two instances belong to the same class. Under this approach, we present two models. The more effective model uses two embedding matrices of a pair of instances as two channels of a CNN. The output probabilities from such pairs are used to judge whether a test instance is from a seen class or is novel/unexpected. Experimental results show that the proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.},

The Keynesian Welfare State (KWS) is examined as an aspect of the ‘counter movement for societal protection’ and the outcome of selection from a much broader array of institutional and cultural responses to crisis. With the KWS, the principles of reciprocity and autarchy (the re-embedding of subsistence and provisioning activity in a modern Gemeinschaft) give way to the establishment of new, top-down circuits of redistribution, designed to facilitate continuing processes of capitalist modernization. Where social innovation is directed at the broad dynamics of marketization and the commodification of goods and services, this growth imperative continues to present an insuperable obstacle to system-level change. But as ecological capital at the level of the biosphere becomes a critical focus for a new protective ‘counter-movement’ and ‘degrowth’ becomes the de facto context for social innovation, systemic transformation becomes more thinkable. Hodgson's ‘evotopia’ is recommended as a heuristic for a provisional, experimental and incremental exploration of the ‘adjacent possible’.},

IS research has expanded far beyond its initial focus by generating new knowledge within but also attracting increased attention from adjacent fields. As a result, the broad understanding of IS and its diversity in applications has resulted in blurry boundaries of the field, making its contemporary delineation, synthesis, and assessment of its progress challenging. Using a combination of data-driven techniques from bibliometrics, natural language processing, and network analysis, this paper maps and analyzes the structure of knowledge production and the process of knowledge integration in current research. We find an overall growing tendency toward increasing diversity in the knowledge bases from which the field draws, accompanied by a decreasing coherence of collective research efforts. We point to the crucial role of institutions and academic entrepreneurs in shaping these developments in interdisciplinary and diverse fields, illustrating this by the role of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).},

  abstract = {The intensification of agriculture has resulted in more homogeneous landscapes and declines of many species associated with farmland or other semi-natural open habitats. In parallel, forestry has also intensified causing declines in many species associated with old-growth forests. While intensive forestry negatively affects forest species, it inadvertently creates new habitats such as clear-cuts, which attracts some farmland species. To understand the potential of clear-cuts as alternative habitat for farmland species, we need to know what makes clear-cuts attractive and whether they are suitable for reproduction and survival. We reviewed literature on the occurrence of farmland birds and butterflies in forest clear-cuts and synthesise the current knowledge on factors and characteristics affecting their occurrence. Many farmland birds and butterflies do indeed use clear-cuts, and have been found in clear-cuts up to ten years after felling. Clear-cut characteristics of importance include age, size, retention structures, land-use history and landscape composition. However, direct measures of resource abundance such as food and hostplants are often lacking. In addition to the potential benefit of individual clear-cuts, the total clear-cut area in forested regions is often large. Together with the fact that clear-cuts may be occupied by farmland species for several years, the potential of clear-cuts as alternative habitat for farmland biodiversity is substantial. Clear-cuts with a history as meadows, the presence of species of conservation importance, or shorter distance to farmland could for example be motivations for focusing conservation efforts on farmland species instead of forest species. Gaining more knowledge on how farmland species use clear-cuts, and what characteristics they depend on, could help inform management guidelines. We are no advocates for forest clear-cuts, but given their ubiquity in forested landscapes, the potential of clear-cuts as alternative habitats for species suffering from loss of suitable farmland habitats is worth serious attention from a conservation perspective.},

  abstract = {Economic research has identified innovation as a key engine for economic growth, competitiveness and employment. This is not only relevant for high-tech industries but to all sectors and economies, including forestry and rural areas. There are different approaches to study innovation. One is to study innovation as a linear process. Another is to study innovation as a complex phenomenon from a systems perspective. The latter has been widely applied in innovation research over the last decade. The systems view has been very fruitful in describing the empirical realities in the emergence of innovations, including the role of a multitude of actors and interactions. In order to be able to provide policy relevant advise for innovation policy on the basis of a sound theoretical foundation that builds on empirical realities, however, the conceptual frameworks need further development and refinement. The objective of this paper is to link a linear innovation process concept on firm level with an innovation system model and to apply it to forestry. The empirical data was collected through nation-wide surveys amongst forest holdings, from institutional level actors and from case studies in seven Central European countries, undertaken in the context of the EFI Regional Project Centre Innoforce. Based on the two conceptual frameworks and the empirical findings from the innovation surveys and case studies, the paper identifies a range of weaknesses in the current set-up of innovation systems. Subsequently, it develops a set of innovation policy recommendations that are considerably different from current forest policy designs. The paper comes to the conclusion that the innovation systems model, despite the need for further development, is a promising approach for scientists to analyse innovation as a complex phenomenon and provides forest policy makers with a new perspective on how to promote innovation in forestry.},

The chapter begins with an illustration of the problem of identifying macroeconomic shocks, followed by an overview of the many recent innovations for identifying shocks. It then reviews in detail three main types of shocks: monetary, fiscal, and technology. After surveying the literature, each section presents new estimates that compare and synthesize key parts of the literature. The penultimate section briefly summarizes a few additional shocks. The final section analyzes the extent to which the leading shock candidates can explain fluctuations in output and hours. It concludes that we are much closer to understanding the shocks that drive economic fluctuations than we were 20 years ago.},

  abstract = {Obtaining indicators on innovation activities of firms has been a challenge in economic research for a long time. The most frequently used indicators - R\&D expenditure and patents - provide an incomplete picture as they represent inputs and throughputs in the innovation process. Output measurement of innovation has strongly been relying on survey data such as the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), but suffers from several shortcomings typical to sample surveys, including incomplete coverage of the firm sector, low timeliness and limited comparability across industries and firms. The availability of big data sources has initiated new efforts to collect innovation data at the firm level. This paper discusses recent attempts of using digital big data sources on firms for generating firm-level innovation indicators, including Websites and social media. It summarises main challenges when using big data and proposes avenues for future research.},

Wittgenstein (Philosophical investigations (trans: Anscombe GEM). Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1958) argued that definitions are not sufficient to determine meaning or to legislate correct usage of words. For both singular terms and general concepts, meaning is meaning-as-use, proceeding via examples that instruct within an already existing normative structure. Once we are clear on the ways in which use presupposes a normative structure, I believe we will understand better the meaning of sustainability and its normative basis. On this view, sustainability will be vague and contested (Jacobs in Fairness and futurity. Oxford University Press, New York, pp 21–45, 1999) but not meaningless. And we will not have to be worried about the plethora of definitions.},

Apart from the regularly-used environmental management certificates, the ability of wood material to store carbon and the use of sustainable forest management certificates open up interesting strategic options for firms in the implementation of their environmental policy. The primary was collected through thematic managerial interviews in 2011 from 37 companies in Finland, Sweden and Norway, of varying size, roles in the value chain, conditions for green business practices and exports. Forest certification and environmental management systems were frequently used, but managers did not always perceive them to be useful, particularly for raising environmental awareness at the final consumer level. Nevertheless, the general attitude towards using environmental performance measures was seen as positive. Companies with a business-to-business orientation were the most proactive in terms of environmental communication, whereas companies in consumer markets were more reactive. The key stakeholders targeted for environmental communication were value chain partners and the authorities, and only to a lesser degree employees and environmental non-governmental organisations. The key strategic role of environmental management and communication appeared to be securing the firms against negative environmental claims. The Nordic wood industry could improve their communication if the strategic orientation is shifted from the forest certification to the use of generic eco-labels, and most of all, to the adoption of quantitative measures like carbon footprints and environmental product declarations.

  abstract = {The need for challenge-led innovation policies to address grand societal challenges is increasingly recognised at various policy levels. This raises questions how to overcome a variety of ‘failures’ prohibiting innovations to flourish. A key-line of thought in theory and policy emerged since the late 1990s on the role of system failures, next to more conventional market-failure thinking. More recently, scholarly work introduced the notion of ‘transformational failures’, which implies an even broader perspective on innovation failures as resting in challenges related to transforming entire systems of production and consumption. This paper combines the literature on Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) with literature on multi-level approaches to sustainability transitions to make a contribution to this debate. In particular, this paper argues that the current literature, so far, has failed to explore how different kinds of policies, or policy mixes, can overcome transformational failures. The paper uses a simulation model (i.e. a system dynamics model) and illustrative examples on electric vehicles to explore relations between transformational failures and (mixes of) policy interventions. A key conclusion is that, in particular in the case where an emerging TIS is in a competitive relation with an incumbent system, overcoming transformational failures can be realised either by directly addressing the incumbent system, for instance by taking away its resources (which may be political challenging). Alternatively, the model results show that a clever mix of policy interventions elsewhere in the system may lead to sufficient performance improvements of the emerging TIS so that it can challenge the incumbent system on its own – albeit with a need for substantial additional resources.},

Herein, using a 5-year open-air experiment in southern boreal forest, we show divergent responses to modest climate alteration among juveniles of nine co-occurring North American tree species. Warming alone (+1.6\,°C or +3.1\,°C above ambient temperature) or combined with reduced rainfall increased the juvenile mortality of all species, especially boreal conifers. Species differed in growth responses to warming, ranging from enhanced growth in Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum to severe growth reductions in Abies balsamea, Picea glauca and Pinus strobus. Moreover, treatment-induced changes in both photosynthesis and growth help explain treatment-driven changes in survival. Treatments in which species experienced conditions warmer or drier than at their range margins resulted in the most adverse impacts on growth and survival. Species abundant in southern boreal forests had the largest reductions in growth and survival due to climate manipulations. By contrast, temperate species that experienced little mortality and substantial growth enhancement in response to warming are rare throughout southern boreal forest and unlikely to rapidly expand their density and distribution. Therefore, projected climate change will probably cause regeneration failure of currently dominant southern boreal species and, coupled with their slow replacement by temperate species, lead to tree regeneration shortfalls with potential adverse impacts on the health, diversity and ecosystem services of regional forests.},

Therefore, for monitoring purposes, conventional indicator-based frameworks need to be combined with approaches that capture and describe the links and interdependencies between the Goals and their targets. In this study, we propose a datadriven Bayesian network (BN) approach to identify and interpret SDGs interlinkages. We focus our analysis on the interlinkages of SDG 6, related to water and sanitation, across the whole 2030 Agenda, using SDG global available data corresponding to 179 countries, 16 goals, 28 targets and 44 indicators. To analyze and validate the BN results, we first demonstrate the robustness of the BN approach in identifying indicator relationships (i.e. consistent results throughout different country sample sizes). Second, we show the coherency of the results by comparing them with an exhaustive study developed by UN-Water. As an added value, our data-driven approach provides further interlinkages, which are contrasted against the existing literature. We conclude that the approach adopted is useful to accommodate a thorough analysis and interpretation of the complexities and interdependencies of the SDGs.},

To investigate the importance of the factors, this research made use of a mixed methodology. 1634 digital news magazine articles and corporate communications were collected in a database describing the development and introduction of 176 new products from 158 companies using low-waste, circular, or “fair” production processes and new materials such as organic, recycled, bio-based synthetic fabrics. From the product and innovation managers responsible, a sample of 33 respondents participated in a survey, where their products had to be evaluated using operationalizations of three success aspects and fourteen success factors. Additionally, five sustainable textile product innovation experts characterized all 176 products in a similar manner, based on the information in the database. Relying on an indirect benchmarking approach both samples produce similar conclusions. The most important success factors are customer expectation fulfillment (in first place) followed by compliance with laws and regulations, green creativity, knowledge about factors that drive sustainable buying, investments in R\&D infrastructure, and competitor monitoring. While the importance of market acceptance and the understanding of customers’ perspectives is highlighted, the research makes a contribution to the literature on success factors of sustainable textile innovations.},

To fully reap the potential of phase-out in sustainability transitions, we call for a more integrative body of scholarship. We identify three important avenues to advance this agenda: First, shifting the unit of analysis to socio-technical systems and the reconfiguration of entire regimes will help to elucidate the multiple logics underlying phase-outs. Second, deepening insights on the timing and interaction between phase-out and innovation will unveil the potential of phase-outs in accelerating transitions. Finally, engaging with issues of power, political legitimacy, and equity is required to mitigate political challenges.},

To accomplish this, we capitalise on (1) the experiences of existing indicator frameworks; (2) stakeholder knowledge and expectations; and (3) national experiences and expertise. This approach is taken to ensure coherence with other bioeconomy-related European monitoring frameworks, the usefulness for decision-making and consistency with national and international initiatives to monitor the bioeconomy. We develop a conceptual framework, based on the definition of a sustainable bioeconomy as stated in the Strategy, for a holistic analysis of the trends in the bioeconomy sectors, following the three pillars of sustainability (economy, society and environment). From this conceptual framework, we derive an implementation framework that aims to highlight the synergies and trade-offs across the five objectives of the Bioeconomy Strategy in a coherent way.

Going beyond routine appeals for more ‘political will’, it organises ideas and examples under three themes: 1) the role of coalitions in supporting and hindering acceleration; 2) the role of feedbacks, through which policies may shape actor preferences which, in turn, create stronger policies; and 3) the role of broader contexts (political economies, institutions, cultural norms, and technical systems) in creating more (or less) favourable conditions for deliberate acceleration. We discuss the importance of each theme, briefly review previous research and articulate new research questions.

  abstract = {Abstract. The unprecedented use of Earth's resources by humans, in combination with increasing natural variability in natural processes over the past century, is affecting the evolution of the Earth system. To better understand natural processes and their potential future trajectories requires improved integration with and quantification of human processes. Similarly, to mitigate risk and facilitate socio-economic development requires a better understanding of how the natural system (e.g. climate variability and change, extreme weather events, and processes affecting soil fertility) affects human processes. Our understanding of these interactions and feedback between human and natural systems has been formalized through a variety of modelling approaches. However, a common conceptual framework or set of guidelines to model human–natural-system feedbacks is lacking. The presented research lays out a conceptual framework that includes representing model coupling configuration in combination with the frequency of interaction and coordination of communication between coupled models. Four different approaches used to couple representations of the human and natural system are presented in relation to this framework, which vary in the processes represented and in the scale of their application. From the development and experience associated with the four models of coupled human–natural systems, the following eight lessons were identified that if taken into account by future coupled human–natural-systems model developments may increase their success: (1)~leverage the power of sensitivity analysis with models, (2)~remember modelling is an iterative process, (3)~create a common language, (4)~make code open-access, (5)~ensure consistency, (6)~reconcile spatio-temporal mismatch, (7)~construct homogeneous units, and (8)~incorporating feedback increases non-linearity and variability. Following a discussion of feedbacks, a way forward to expedite model coupling and increase the longevity and interoperability of models is given, which suggests the use of a wrapper container software, a standardized applications programming interface~(API), the incorporation of standard names, the mitigation of sunk costs by creating interfaces to multiple coupling frameworks, and the adoption of reproducible workflow environments to wire the pieces together.},

Yet, there is little research on how their structural composition and role evolve in advanced transitions and which tensions arise over time. We address these gaps by combining insights from network research in social and economic science with transition studies, where networking organizations are conceptualized as intermediaries and elements of Technological Innovation Systems. We synthesize a framework capturing the evolution of and resulting tensions within networking organizations in sustainability transitions. It is applied to two regional energy networking organizations from Germany. We draw on qualitative expert interviews and a complementary social network analysis. We show that networking organizations do not necessarily stabilize once the initial technologies they were centered around become established. Instead, their member base broadens to different sectors. This can lead to tensions over the networking organizations' scope. Tensions also arise from misalignments between ‘private’ goals of member firms and the ‘public’ goal of transforming system-level structures. Furthermore, complementary or competing networking organizations might emerge during the transition. We conclude by outlining responses to these tensions, which might help practitioners to maintain the legitimacy of networking organizations and their relevance in the transition.},

Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.},

The energy sector is at the core of any modern economy, and Germany serves as an international showcase for the transition of a large industrialized economy to a low-carbon energy system. Diverse actors, organizational models, and technologies have contributed to the initiation of Germany's energy transition through a wide range of community renewable energy projects. The think piece investigates how far these diverse actors embrace the aims of the Degrowth movement. It also provides a critical account of on-the-ground realities through six hypotheses and contrasts them with claims made by the Degrowth movement. It is suggested that community renewable energy projects are at a crossroads. While many projects have familiarized thousands of people with alternative economic models, there is little evidence of a general change in attitudes towards technology, consumption, or equity. In conclusion, a major effort is needed to open initiatives to less affluent actors, oppose recent trends of commodification, and prevent community renewable energy projects from being engrossed by the dominant political and economic system.},

  abstract = {The bioeconomy is a collective of activities charged with the production of biologically renewable resources or ‘biomass’ (e.g. agriculture, forestry), its diverse application (e.g. food, textiles, construction, chemicals) and subsequent reuse (e.g. compositing, waste management). Since the European Union (EU) launched its bioeconomy strategy in 2012, further bioeconomy policy initiatives have proliferated at regional, national and pan-European levels. Moreover, the EU Green Deal announced in 2019 targets a transition towards a low-carbon sustainable model of growth, food and energy security, biodiversity and natural resource management, where it is envisaged that the bioeconomy will play a key role. Despite a paucity of available data, the surge in policy interest has triggered the need for evidence-based monitoring of bioeconomy sectors and the efficient tailoring of policy support. Thus, on a Member State (MS) basis for the period 2008–2017, we (1) adopt an ‘output-based’ approach to construct a panel data of performance indicators and (2) characterise the sources of growth and transitional stage of the bioeconomy. Results reveal that the bioeconomy has maintained its relative importance within the total EU27 economy. At the EU level, agriculture and the food industry have played a key role in driving a transition in the primary and industrial bioeconomy sectors due to their significant labour productivity-enhancing impact. Four Northern MS exhibit a bioeconomy transition by modernising their bioeconomy activities and operating structural changes. Other Northern and Western EU MS are still in the early stages of a transition, whilst in Eastern and Central Europe, such a transition remains elusive.},

ICTs also constitute a system of technologies with stronger internal links since the emergence of the Internet and broadband as a new information infrastructure. The new infrastructure has co-evolved with widespread integration of ICTs in everyday life, and consumer demand has been decisive for ICT innovation. This article explores the environmental directionality of ICT innovation and the broadband transition, focusing mainly on energy impacts. It is argued that much innovation tends to develop in an unsustainable direction and that public regulation falls far short of the challenge. Transition theory is applied to analyze the background for the unsustainable development and the reasons why environmental concerns do not figure more prominently in the broadband transition. Finally, it is discussed how the direction of ICT innovation could be influenced in order to realize more of the positive sustainability potential.},

A multi-system perspective draws attention to: the present functional and structural couplings that link systems of interest; emerging sites of interaction that could bring systems further into contact; along with the patterns marking system interactions and their implications for sustainability transitions. Attending more carefully to multi-system dynamics complements several promising directions of inquiry identified by the agenda for sustainability transitions research, including recent efforts to broaden the scope of analysis, capture the pervasiveness of change, and consider opportunities for acceleration.},

The promotion of green jobs fuels questionable ideas, among which that there are green vs non-green jobs, and that the latter can be progressively replaced by green jobs. The option of developing jobs that could act to offset environmental damage is also attractive. Based on a social-ecological approach and the “strong sustainability” paradigm, the paper develops and tests a three-dimensional framework to highlight the complex and multifaceted relationship between employment growth and biodiversity enhancement. Three case studies are investigated using field expertise: slope revegetation, soil bioengineering and guided nature tours. The framework includes direct impacts of jobs on biodiversity, indirect impacts on biodiversity and ecological feedback on employment growth with two types of insights. First, it serves a reflexive analysis on the way these jobs, supposedly green, support and respond to biodiversity enhancement. Second, it helps tailor policy instruments adapted to each ideal-type of biodiversity-employment relationship towards a low biodiversity impacting economy. It highlights the various possible actions – from regulations to communication instruments – along with the types of biodiversity-employment relationships they address the best.},

It is conducted for supporting decision-making and policy in a broad environmental, economic and social context, and transcends a purely technical/scientific evaluation. This paper focusses on the systematisation of knowledge on technical/scientific sustainability evaluation, by addressing critical decision-making elements focussed on by domain experts. We make a distinction between integrated assessment and SA. Our systemic approach outlines how to move from integrated assessment to SA. The fundamental differences involved concern three levels: ontological, methodological and epistemological. We present a novel methodological framework for SA, based on a literature meta-review of multi-scale and multi-purpose appraisal methodologies, models and indicators. SA is essentially a structured procedure encompassing different field-specific analytical methods and models, for specific applications and decision contexts. External inputs to the methodology are “values” considered in the analysis and boundaries defined, including the relevant sustainability framework. Internal methodological elements comprise approach to be adopted (e.g. “what-if” vs. “what-to”), scenario design and analytical models and measurable indicators for an operational analysis. Methods to quantify uncertainty are key ingredients of the assessment framework. The paper highlights the relevance of and policy challenges for SA development, with due attention for applicability in real-world decision contexts.},

We thus provide seven rules to extend the use of sensitivity analysis (or how to apportion uncertainty in model-based inference among input factors) in a process of sensitivity auditing of models used in a policy context. Each rule will be illustrated by examples.},

To what extent does the choice of the methodology condition the narrative produced by the analysis? The present work argues that the two questions are tightly coupled. The technique is never neutral. If we are the tools of our tools, as suggested by Thoreau, then it can also be said that language is not only a vehicle for communication, it is the driver as well. For this reason, in sustainability assessment it is not unusual to discern a close relationship between arguments made and methods adopted. In the present work a set of six reflexive analytical tools – we call them lenses – is suggested which could be pooled to the effect to appraise and improve the quality of integrated assessment and the resulting sustainability narratives, and to alleviate the constraints of the method-argument dependency. None of the lenses is new and each has been used before. Never have they been used together. The lenses are (i) Post-normal science (PNS), (ii) Controversy studies, (iii) Sensitivity auditing, (iv) Bioeconomics, (v) Ethics of science for governance, and (vi) Non-Ricardian economics. The six lenses are illustrated together with a set of case/narratives/arguments. The lenses allow some narratives – or methodologies – to be shown as either implausible or inadequate, and new narratives to be developed to tackle pressing sustainability issues, which expand the horizon of possible strategies for a solution.},

  abstract = {There has been a growing significance for the National Innovation System (NIS) and its use as a tool for the competitive advantage of a country to date. In this paper, an NIS model has been developed with the use of system dynamics (SD) methodological approach. The objective of this model is to integrate the systemic approach, the computer modelling and the simulation discipline into a holistic dynamic consideration of the NIS. From this central structure, the paper analyzes the impact of innovation policies on the NIS performance. In particular the SD model is used as an “experimental tool” to conduct extensive what-if analysis scenarios with regard to alternative innovation policies. The effectiveness of policies is investigated through the dynamic behaviour of product innovation and process innovation which are obtained by simulation results. By using data from a European Union country with innovation performance below that of the EU27 average, the analysis of results reveals insights over a strategic time horizon.},

  abstract = {This article revisits Ivan Illich's call for limiting the use of tools and elaborates its implications for degrowth. Illich analyzed growth not as an economic ideology, but - more radically - as the result of a historically unique mindset that turns tools from means into ends. Unlike many advocates of degrowth, he did not propose alternative modes of resource consumption and distribution, but instead tried to defend vernacular subsistence and conviviality against the industrialized satisfaction of needs. Any meaningful limit to growth, Illich insisted, has to be rooted in the defense of a sphere beyond production and consumption. Yet, as he himself realized, in an advanced technological society this distinction between autonomous action and heteronomous need satisfaction is blurred. Modern tools e and especially the computer - not only paralyze innate capabilities, but shape self-perception and subjectivities so as to increase dependencies on technological systems. On the basis of Illich's works, this article will argue first that degrowth requires limits to material as well as immaterial technologies, including political management and professional services; second that these limits have to be based on the appropriate balance between vernacular subsistence and engineered instrumentalities: and, third, that political decisions demand the cultivation of a critical awareness of the symbolic power of modern technologies.},

The effects of reindeer numbers were inconclusive in explaining the decrease in lichen-abundant forest. The role that forestry has played in causing this decline can be debated, but forestry can have a significant role in reversing the trend and improving ground lichen conditions.},

In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40\%, while retaining 97\% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60\% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

The literature review on a resilience thinking approach and stakeholders’ perceptions have contributed to the design of a resilience strategic framework (RSF) as an analytical tool for measuring the possibilities of substantial change in the socio-ecosystem with associated attributes in five resilience strategic areas. The study concludes that PFO current strategies (persistence and safeguarding) do not suffice alone to create a territorial policy plan and change scenarios. New attributes based on adaptation, creation and transformation towards rural recapitalisation are required. The change would target increasing interdependence (between sectors, stakeholders and territories), improving capabilities in the context and increasing stakeholder and community control. This would involve overcoming current barriers and designing ‘resilience governance’ based on integration, innovation and future orientation to rural transformation.},

This paper takes a biophysical perspective and explores how declining fossil stocks and a global transition towards renewable energies ultimately drive the land rush. The paper addresses, in qualitative terms, how societal needs for land change with different patterns of societal energy metabolism. The potential spatial expansions of renewables are illustrated in quantitative terms, based on the power density concept and energy provision forecasts for the year 2020. The transition from an energy system based on fossils stocks, with high power densities, to one based on renewables, with low power densities, drastically boosts societal demand for land. This drives the land rush directly through land acquisitions for the expansion of energy systems. The energy transition also drives the land rush indirectly, in particular through food security threats motivated by the growing competition over farmland uses and changes in crop supply. Although currently fossil stocks are still relatively abundant, future declines are expected to trigger the demand for land to even greater extents. Given the inevitability of the energy transition, we believe that the land rush will have persistence, bearing long-term consequences for land use and struggles over access to land.},

The IS framework already serves as a suitable and influential basis for research on processes of technological innovation and economic change. We argue that improving the capacity of an IS framework for dealing with wicked problems and the normative complexity of sustainability requires a fundamental paradigm shift because in the current IS paradigm innovations are considered as per se desirable and in mostly technological terms. Therefore, we call for IS dedicated to transformations towards sustainability by opening up for systemic innovations beyond the technological dimension and by acknowledging that stakeholders have conflicting visions, interests, norms, and expectations with regard to sustainability goals. Taking the normative dimension of transformations towards sustainability seriously thus requires more explicit and integrative research on directionality, legitimacy, responsibility, and their interrelation in IS. The article concludes by proposing suggestions for future research based on IS-related approaches that can serve as building blocks for an IS framework capable of incorporating legitimate goal-orientation for transformative innovation by and for society.},

But how can and should researchers respond to this societal demand on science? We argue that answering this question requires systematic engagement with the fundamental normative dimensions of the 2030 Agenda and those of the scientific community—and with the implications these dimensions have for research and practice. We suggest that the production of knowledge relevant to sustainable development entails analytic engagement with norms and values through four tasks. First, to unravel and critically reflect on the ethical values involved in sustainability, values should increasingly become an empirical and theoretical object of sustainability research. Second, to ensure that research on social–ecological systems is related to sustainability values, researchers should reflect on and spell out what sustainability values guide their research, taking into account possible interdependencies, synergies, and trade-offs. Third, to find common ground on what sustainability means for specific situations, scientists should engage in deliberative learning processes with societal actors, with a view to jointly reflecting on existing development visions and creating new, contextualized ones. Fourth, this implies that researchers and scientific disciplines must clarify their own ethical and epistemic values, as this defines accountability and shapes identification of problems, research questions, and results. We believe that ignoring these tasks, whether one is in favor or critical of the 2030 Agenda, will undermine the credibility and relevance of scientific contributions for sustainable development.},

  abstract = {The pressure on land resources continuously increases not only with the rising demand for agricultural commodities, but also with the growing need for action on global challenges, such as biodiversity loss or climate change, where land plays a crucial role. Land saving as a strategy, where agricultural productivity is increased to allow a reduction of required cropland while sustaining production volumes and meeting demand, could address this trade-off. With our interdisciplinary model-based study, we globally assess regional potentials of land saving and analyze resulting effects on agricultural production, prices and trade. Thereby, different land saving strategies are investigated that (1) minimize required cropland (2) minimize spatial marginalization induced by land saving and (3) maximize the attainable profit. We find that current cropland requirements could be reduced between 37\% and 48\%, depending on the applied land saving strategy. The generally more efficient use of land would cause crop prices to fall in all regions, but also trigger an increase in global agricultural production of 2.8\%. While largest land saving potentials occur in regions with high yield gaps, the impacts on prices and production are strongest in highly populated regions with already high pressure on land. Global crop prices and trade affect regional impacts of land saving on agricultural markets and can displace effects to spatially distant regions. Our results point out the importance of investigating the potentials and effects of land saving in the context of global markets within an integrative, global framework. The resulting land saving potentials can moreover reframe debates on global potentials for afforestation and carbon sequestration, as well as on how to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity conservation and thus contribute to approaching central goals of the 21st century, addressed for example in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement or the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.},

  abstract = {Identifying and clearly communicating the drivers of ecosystem function is a crucially important goal for both basic and applied ecology. This has proven difficult because the putative causes (e.g., environment, species identity, biodiversity, and functional traits) are numerous and correlated. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of a formal framework for unambiguously relating theoretical language to precise, quantitative expressions of that language. Using a formal framework for the graphical expression of complex causal hypotheses, we developed a causal diagram of the concepts required to comprehensively test whether hypothesized sets of functional traits mediate the relationship between community structure and ecosystem function. We then used causal analysis, simulations, and field data to develop and test analytical strategies for understanding how community structure influences ecosystem functions via functional traits. Formal causal analysis showed that biodiversity–ecosystem function correlations are noncausal associations. Using simulations, we showed how biodiversity correlations and species identity effects can arise from misspecification or incomplete mediation by functional trait composites. We also found that different types of model misspecification result in different patterns of residuals, which may be used to diagnose gaps in functional trait hypotheses. Treating the model misspecifications eliminated associations between species identity or biodiversity and ecosystem function. Finally, we provide an example of the analysis of field data to demonstrate how to use these insights to conduct a research program that has the goal of understanding the mechanistic trait relationships that link community structure to ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Industrial society has not only led to high levels of wealth and welfare in the Western world, but also to increasing global ecological degradation and social inequality. The socio-technical systems that underlay contemporary societies have substantially contributed to these outcomes. This paper proposes that these socio-technical systems are an expression of a limited number of meta-rules that, for the past 250 years, have driven innovation and hence system evolution in a particular direction, thereby constituting the First Deep Transition. Meeting the cumulative social and ecological consequences of the overall direction of the First Deep Transition would require a radical change, not only in socio-technical systems but also in the meta-rules driving their evolution – the Second Deep Transition. This paper develops a new theoretical framework that aims to explain the emergence, acceleration, stabilization and directionality of Deep Transitions. It does so through the synthesis of two literatures that have attempted to explain large-scale and long-term socio-technical change: the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, and Techno-economic Paradigm (TEP) framework.},

The targeted use of biological resources for industrial purposes can help to successfully reconcile ecology and economy in the long term. Like digitalization, biologization as the guiding principle of the bioeconomy has the potential to effect a fundamental change in industry. This change must be driven and supported by a committed research and innovation policy. The German Federal Government was one of the first governments worldwide to put the bioeconomy on its research policy agenda when it adopted the “National Research Strategy BioEconomy 2030” in 2010. The respective national policy strategy was published two years later. Since then we have been successfully implementing measures to establish the bioeconomy. Our research programme is currently being developed further. Our aim is to strengthen the biobased transformation process towards a sustainable economy and to attach special importance to innovative technologies. Furthermore, bioeconomy research policy will have to be aimed more strongly towards achieving international goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to showing what contribution the bioeconomy can make in this context. The success of the bioeconomy requires a societal discourse on how our society can reconcile economic growth and sustainability in future. This requires the adaptation and continued development of national agendas and initiatives as well as efficient international cooperation.},

The EU has increasingly embraced social innovation as a mean for addressing these challenges and rebuilding resilience. However, it is not yet clear how to evaluate these emergent processes in terms of dynamics, performances and impacts, e.g. enhanced human wellbeing. Specific methodologies for social innovation evaluation in rural and forest-dependent communities have not been agreed yet. This qualitative paper is based on the initial stages of a science-stakeholder collaboration carried out within the 4-years EU funded Horizon 2020 project titled Social Innovation in Marginalised Rural Areas (SIMRA) on evaluation methods. Its aims are to: (1) provide an overview of what aspects of social innovation should be evaluated, and (2) describe the characteristics of an evaluation method that would capture such aspects, with a focus on forestry domain. Results show that a suite of qualitative and quantitative methods and indicators are required, as well as a combination of expert and participatory-based evaluation approaches capturing both elements of the social innovation process and their outcomes, as well as primary data from social innovation initiatives at local level. More attention is needed on soft data such as satisfaction, feelings and happiness of involved actors and beneficiaries, as well as on environmental aspects, than on the pure economic efficiency and impacts, considering the effects of social innovation in forest ecosystem services.},

The primary colonizers are subsequently replaced by secondary species; on mesic and moist soils commonly by Picea abies. Many swamp forests have developed from deciduous Betula/Alnus fens to Picea abies swamp forests during the last 3500 years, since Picea became common in this region. Our objective was to study the long-term vegetation development, fire history and succession patterns of a boreal swamp forest in N Sweden. The area was characterized by Betula trees, and there were no signs of recent fire. We wished to investigate whether Betula dominance was a result of succession after disturbance other than fire, or an exception to the general rule that normally Picea abies is the dominating secondary species in this region. The study included analyses of pollen and charred particles along with AMS dating. Our results revealed that Betula has been the dominant tree species in the swamp forest for 8000 years. The vegetation developed from a deciduous wet forest, via forest fen, to the present swamp forest; Betula spp. has been both pioneer and secondary species. The scarcity of charred particles suggests that severe fires have been rare in the Betula swamp forest. The vegetation development at the study site has been governed by long-term mire development, local nutrient conditions and the low impact of fire. The lack of stand-replacing fire at the study site is probably the reason why Betula still dominates the swamp forest investigated, although Picea had become common in other parts of the region c. 3500 years BP. The study has shown that is is not possible to apply a general succession model to all situations during the Holocene but that succession patterns depend highly on site-specific conditions.},

Women perform a variety of functions at different stages in the value chains, but their roles tend to be poorly visible and inadequately acknowledged, largely because they are either operating in the informal sector, are part-time employees, or carry out their activities at home between family responsibilities. Where women’s roles are more prominent, this is primarily due to gender orientated interventions by external agencies. Several constraints to fostering women’s empowerment were identified, with some easier to overcome than others. Particularly difficult to address are gender based, social-cultural barriers. Suggestions for enhancing women’s benefits include: greater recognition of informal markets, the opportunities and constraints associated with them, and their position relative to export markets; improved support for collective action where this can provide women with greater voice, negotiating power, and help with economies of scale; more targeted training that addresses areas identified by women as useful and important to them; time-saving technologies and support systems such as child care; and creating greater gender awareness amongst stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Limiting global warming to well below 2°C requires a dramatic acceleration of decarbonization to reduce net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to zero around mid-century. In complex systems – including human societies – tipping points can occur, in which a small perturbation transforms a system. Crucially, activating one tipping point can increase the likelihood of triggering another at a larger scale, and so on. Here, we show how such upward-scaling tipping cascades could accelerate progress in tackling climate change. We focus on two sectors – light road transport and power – where tipping points have already been triggered by policy interventions at individual nation scales. We show how positive-sum cooperation, between small coalitions of jurisdictions and their policymakers, could lead to global changes in the economy and emissions. The aim of activating tipping points and tipping cascades is a particular application of systems thinking. It represents a different starting point for policy to the theory of welfare economics, one that can be useful when the priority is to achieve dynamic rather than allocative efficiency.Key policy insights Pricing policies and targeted investments that bring clean technologies below the threshold of cost-parity with fossil fuel technologies can trigger reinforcing feedbacks that cascade up scales to propel disproportionately rapid decarbonization.Traditional approaches to climate policy based on welfare economics principles of minimizing marginal abatement costs, and pricing externalities, are likely to miss these opportunities. Systems thinking can help identify ways for policy to drive effective change.Positive-sum cooperation between small groups of countries can accelerate the activation of tipping points in the global economy, facilitating decarbonization in all countries. Early opportunities for this are in the power and light road transport sectors, where clean technologies are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels.The value of decarbonization policies should be judged not just on their immediate effects on emissions within the implementing jurisdiction, but also for their potential to contribute to upward-scaling tipping cascades in the global economy.},

Therefore, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is investigated using a Composite Index of Environmental Performance (CIEP) and Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (Panel ARDL) approach. The CIEP model is based on the Driving Force-Pressure-State- Exposure -Effects-Action (DPSEEA) framework and is generated by 19 indicators. The results of this study showed that the driving forces and pressure have negative impacts on environmental performance, thereby reducing the number of available resources. In addition, the results revealed that actions increase life expectancy while reducing the mortality rate and environmental impact. The average CIEP revealed that among MENA countries, Iran (−0.226), Algeria (−0.168), and Yemen (−0.134) had the lowest amounts, while Emirate (0.036), Kuwait (0.036), and Qatar (0.033) had the highest values. The results of the panel data model revealed a cubic polynomial correlation and an N-shaped pattern between economic growth and CIEP. Therefore, MENA countries must pay attention to sustainable development to preserve the environment.},

This article highlights one striking example of continuity that becomes easier to see after taking off the neoliberal lens—namely the commitment to discretionary management of the macroeconomy, often short-handed as Keynesianism. It begins with a survey linking the development of a politics centered around managing the economy to the making of what Karen Orren and Stephen Skowronek have termed a “policy state.” Next it considers the role of economists within the policy state, paying particular attention to what it calls the MIT school of economics. Then it uses the career of Lawrence Klein, an exemplary product of the MIT school, to illuminate the politics of the economy in a supposedly neoliberal age.},

  abstract = {Justice theory is intended to guide practical choices, but justice theories struggle to inform many decisions that must be made in climate change adaptation practice. This paper highlights gaps between theory and practice by analyzing the justice dimensions of dilemmas routinely faced by adaptation administrators, using the example of property acquisitions to ground the analysis. Justice theories struggle to assist decision-makers in: prioritizing distribution of resources; distributing programs that cause both harms and benefits; weighing uncertain harms and benefits; identifying participants and resolving conflicts in participatory processes; and redressing historic injustices. Proposals to improve adaptation justice that do not address one or more of the practical dilemmas faced by administrators are unlikely to advance the cause. Absent theoretical or policy guidance, decisions are often shaped by administrators’ unconscious heuristics such as views on the role of government and the purpose of buyouts. Tailoring justice-relevant decisions to local contexts may provide greater benefits than a universal approach to justice, but a relative approach is most likely to be just when justice-relevant decisions are transparent and informed by theoretical and empirical work. Transparency is critical for accountability, evaluation, and policy learning. Justice decisions are often constrained by limited authority, resources, and institutional goals, so achieving greater justice in climate adaptation may require changes in the larger governance systems within which adaptation decisions are made. More nuanced evaluations of adaptation justice, more comparative analyses, enabled by greater transparency in practice, and more holistic approaches to adaptation governance are recommended moving forward.},

  abstract = {The issues of sustainability, efficiency, and profitability in private forestry dominated debate on Finnish and Swedish forest policy throughout the 20th century. The management and utilization of private forests have been significant for these countries since more than half of productive forest land has been owned by families. Forests have also played an important role in Finland’s and Sweden’s national economies. There was however no consensus among forest owners and forestry experts—forest scientists and forestry authorities—about the methods of achieving forestry sustainability and profitability, particularly in the early 1900s. This article focuses on the types of argument on which perceptions of good forest management were based, and the reasons for their use. The article also explores how disagreements and occasional open conflicts between private forest owners and forest authorities were solved, and what kind of regulative means were developed to avoid such differences. There are three main reasons for making a case study of Finland and Sweden: Firstly, the forest sector has played an important role in their national economies, secondly, the objectives and content of their forestry laws are quite similar, and thirdly, the tradition of family forest ownership has remained strong. The debate on good forest management in this period revolves around the two silvicultural paradigms: even-aged and uneven-aged systems. The former concerns formal, scientific knowledge of forest management, and the latter takes a traditional approach.},

Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritization based on reinforcement learning that consistently outperforms available state-of-the-art software using simulated and empirical data. Our methodology, conservation area prioritization through artificial intelligence (CAPTAIN), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a limited budget, our model protects significantly more species from extinction than areas selected randomly or naively (such as based on species richness). CAPTAIN achieves substantially better solutions with empirical data than alternative software, meeting conservation targets more reliably and generating more interpretable prioritization maps. Regular biodiversity monitoring, even with a degree of inaccuracy characteristic of citizen science surveys, further improves biodiversity outcomes. Artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation and sustainable use of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world.},

It is intended to integrate the conservation of biodiversity with timber production and to maintain the provision of other ecosystem services by retaining important forest qualities, habitats and structures. In this study we seek to identify forces driving the conceptual development, acceptance and implementation of RF in Sweden by describing and investigating the RF debate among foresters and environmental NGOs from 1968 to 2003. Specifically, we seek to elucidate when RF was first proposed, the arguments for and against it, and pivotal trends in the debate. Our study is based on thorough systematic analysis of articles published in journals issued by two non-profit associations. Our data show that the development of RF in Sweden was driven by several interacting factors and we distinguish critical time periods, from strong debates and conflicts during the 1970s until the breakthrough of forestry certification at the turn of the millennium. We argue that historical analysis of the forces driving changes in forestry management is important for elucidating why changes occur and the dynamic nature of perceptions and uses of forest ecosystems in modern societies.},

  abstract = {An analysis of energy and material flows has been elaborated for the Swedish region Jamtland with the aim of monitoring and comparing regional sustainability by following the work energy flow method developed in a study of the Danish island of Samso (Nielsen \& Jorgensen, 2011). In the region of Jamtland about 46,000 TJ of energy flows into society, of which 88\% is renewable. From this an amount corresponding to 30,800 TJ is exported as electricity from the region, while another 410 TJ is exported as waste to be incinerated. The remaining part, about 15,200 TJ (63\% renewable), drives Jamtland. From an energy flow perspective, the most important production from the region, apart from electricity production, is biomass from the forest: 49,000 TJ estimated as energy content in the biomass harvested. Another 55,000 TJ is added to the standing biomass every year as forest growth (only productive forest land area has been calculated). Some suggested indices of sustainability have been calculated and Jamtland shows high values. However, it will be a challenge to transform the quite large transport sector of Jamtland, and therefore the potential to become fully sustainable (ref to indexes used for the Samso study) might not be quite as high. In order to reduce the use of non-renewable energy, a major conversion of the transport fleet is needed, and this should be given high priority. The private sector is the largest single user of non-renewable energy (2,200 TJ). One successful transition is the Swedish diesel mix with 19\% FAME/HVO derived from vegetable or animal sources and regarded as renewable. The consumption of FAME/HVO is predicted to increase significantly, increasing the importance of the forest as a source. A sustainability analysis based at work energy flows shows for both Samso and Jamtland that large natural resources producing a high work energy output combined with low work energy use due to low population density, gives high sustainability indicators. This indicates that regions with high population density and the absence of natural resources (high import), as in most regions in the world, will show low sustainability indicators.},

  abstract = {The cohort is a key concept in the study of social demography and social change. The enduring influence of cohort membership can arise from history-based and/or size-based effects. The most prominent proponent of size-based cohort effects is Easterlin (Birth and fortune: The impact of numbers on personal welfare, 1980) who argues that individuals hailing from unusually large cohorts will experience adverse labor market conditions relative to the members of the smaller cohorts that bracket them. Drawing on data from the March Current Population Survey for the period spanning 1974–2004, we examine the influence of relative cohort size on underemployment. The results provide modest support for the Easterlin thesis, showing the odds of underemployment to be greatest among members of relatively large cohorts, net of other significant predictors. The results also show that the impact of relative cohort size differs by educational level, suggesting that adverse economic conditions produced by large cohort size can be offset by broader changes in the labor market and other social institutions.},

Study has been carried out in Sweden, Spain and Finland, and in four following sectors - furniture, pellets, printing and publishing, and packaging. However, this presentation is dedicated printing and publishing sector. The importance of consumption as an innovation-driver must be taken into account when investigating fields of innovation that can secure sustainability of printing and publishing industries. There is of highest importance for forest-based industries to become aware of needs, perceptions, attitudes and demands of the buyers of fibre-based products in order to recognise which innovations are necessary to implement. Companies should also have high quality information concerning how buyers' actions, behaviour, preferences and changing demands together with those innovations can influence three pillars of sector sustainability: economic sustainability, social sustainability and environmental sustainability. Studies recognized a great necessity to develop a tool that can convert traditional qualitative results into quantitative and measurable results giving direct answer regarding required innovations and their impacts on sustainability. The tool is composed of three parts that can be used separately depending on stage of innovation process that company would like to carry out: Gathering information and data in a qualitative research process. This will give a description of buyers' actions, behaviour, preferences and changing demands Identifying “hot spots”. This results in determination of necessary innovations areas and their linkage to sustainability pillars (quantitative result) Identifying required innovations and estimating their importance level and value of impact regarding sustainability pillars (strategic and sustainable result)},

  abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more ‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

  abstract = {A systematic investigation of growth in nature and society, from tiny organisms to the trajectories of empires and civilizations. Growth has been both an unspoken and an explicit aim of our individual and collective striving. It governs the lives of microorganisms and galaxies; it shapes the capabilities of our extraordinarily large brains and the fortunes of our economies. Growth is manifested in annual increments of continental crust, a rising gross domestic product, a child's growth chart, the spread of cancerous cells. In this magisterial book, Vaclav Smil offers systematic investigation of growth in nature and society, from tiny organisms to the trajectories of empires and civilizations. Smil takes readers from bacterial invasions through animal metabolisms to megacities and the global economy. He begins with organisms whose mature sizes range from microscopic to enormous, looking at disease-causing microbes, the cultivation of staple crops, and human growth from infancy to adulthood. He examines the growth of energy conversions and man-made objects that enable economic activities—developments that have been essential to civilization. Finally, he looks at growth in complex systems, beginning with the growth of human populations and proceeding to the growth of cities. He considers the challenges of tracing the growth of empires and civilizations, explaining that we can chart the growth of organisms across individual and evolutionary time, but that the progress of societies and economies, not so linear, encompasses both decline and renewal. The trajectory of modern civilization, driven by competing imperatives of material growth and biospheric limits, Smil tells us, remains uncertain},

  abstract = {The deployment of biofuels is significantly affected by policy in energy and agriculture. In the energy arena, concerns regarding the sustainability of biofuel systems and their impact on food prices led to a set of sustainability criteria in EU Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy. In addition, the 10\% biofuels target by 2020 was replaced with a 10\% renewable energy in transport target. This allows the share of renewable electricity used by electric vehicles to contribute to the mix in achieving the 2020 target. Furthermore, only biofuel systems that effect a 60\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with the fuel they replace are allowed to contribute to meeting the target. In the agricultural arena, cross-compliance (which is part of EU Common Agricultural Policy) dictates the allowable ratio of grassland to total agricultural land, and has a significant impact on which biofuels may be supported. This paper outlines the impact of these policy areas and their implications for the production and use of biofuels in terms of the 2020 target for 10\% renewable transport energy, focusing on Ireland. The policies effectively impose constraints on many conventional energy crop biofuels and reinforce the merits of using biomethane, a gaseous biofuel. The analysis shows that Ireland can potentially satisfy 15\% of renewable energy in transport by 2020 (allowing for double credit for biofuels from residues and ligno-cellulosic materials, as per Directive 2009/28/EC) through the use of indigenous biofuels: grass biomethane, waste and residue derived biofuels, electric vehicles and rapeseed biodiesel.},

However, many ecosystems change over short timescales; thus, such maps soon become inaccurate. Here we show high rates of short-term dynamics of three key forest ecosystem services: wood production, bilberry production and topsoil carbon storage. Almost 85\% of the coldspots and 65\% of the hotspots for these services had changed into a different state over a ten-year period. Wood production showed higher rates of short-term dynamics than bilberry production and carbon storage. The high rates of dynamics mean that static snapshot ecosystem service maps provide limited information for assessing and managing multifunctional, dynamic landscapes, such as forests. We advocate that dynamic, spatially explicit tools to assess and manage ecosystem service dynamics be further developed and applied in post-2020 biodiversity and ecosystem service policy supporting frameworks.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the development paths leading to the transition to cleaner bleaching technologies in the pulp industry. It devotes particular attention to the key features of the Swedish transition, but also compares this to the Finnish experiences. The empirical investigation builds on an analytical framework highlighting the conditions under which pollution regulations can provide efficient incentives for deep emission reductions at industrial plants. Existing and new archive material, including not least comprehensive license trial acts for Swedish pulp mills over an extended time period, are studied. Based on this historical analysis our findings contradict previous literature, the latter emphasizing that pressures from consumers and the public were the most significant driving forces behind the adoption of–and innovation in–alternative bleaching technologies during the late 1980s. Instead, this paper asserts, the green pulp transition was characterized by regulation-induced technological change and was made possible by long history of industry-wide cooperation in environmental R\&D. Furthermore, while previous research has emphasized the leading role of the Nordic countries in green pulp innovation, we identify a number of profound differences between Finland and Sweden. These emerge from various national contexts in terms of, for instance, industry structures and strategies, political cultures, and regulatory styles. Finally, at a more general level the paper provides a few policy implications for supporting the ongoing transition towards a forest-based bioeconomy.},

  abstract = {Organizations, such as forest management cooperatives (FMCs), are established to support private forest owners to deal with structural and natural challenges that they cannot handle on their own. In 2018, Feil et al. found in a nationwide survey that only 30\% of German private forest owners are members of FMCs. This low participation rate of private forest owners in FMCs in Germany poses a problem for the further development of organizations that can better consider the needs of private forest owners and also meet the timber market's long-term requirements for larger quantities of timber as well as become an equal negotiation partner of the sawmill industry. This problem can be attributed to social interactions, which are considered influential for cooperation between private forest owners. This paper aims to highlight different groups of private forest owners in Germany and their cooperation based on social interaction. To do so, it refers to the categories of actor-centered institutionalism (ACI) and complements these with symbolic interactionism. Methodologically, the paper is based on a quantitative online survey of 1007 private forest owners in Germany. The survey itself was prepared by the authors and conducted by the pollster firm forsa, Germany in the period from 14 to 29 July 2020. In addition to standard research topics in forest related research, such as family tradition and income generation, the questionnaire also focused on social interaction. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on the values of a principal component analysis (PCA) was used both to ensure a neutral view on the data and to create heterogeneous groups of private forest owners. Four distinct clusters were defined through the cluster analysis: “actively exchanging”, “perceivers”, “uninterested” and “self-referential”. These clusters differ mainly in relation to their preferred forms of social interaction. It can be concluded that not only communication but also social interaction in the form of symbolic interaction has an influence on forest owners' cooperation with FMCs. For forestry practice, this means that in regions where there are currently no FMC members, new members could be won in the future by creating forest management activities that encourage cooperation with FMCs.},

It combines forest owner types and their behavioral models with forest decision support systems (DSS). For this, we draw on mainstream decision-making theories in social sciences and relevant empirical evidence from Europe and beyond to suggest how economic, sociological and psychological rationalities can be combined to build a typology and behavioral models of forest owner decision-making including responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic changes. We then discuss how the theory-driven and evidence-based behavioral models in combination with forest owner and forest management insights can be used to analyze forest management behavior and responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic developments. By comparing standard forest DSS modeling results to exemplary results using the agent-based framework in terms of long-term simulations of timber production and biodiversity conservation in a case study in Sweden, we illustrate how the framework accounts for more differentiated and more realistic forest management practices at the forest landscape level. We discuss how the agent-based framework also helps explore and explain the impacts of future policy and socioeconomic changes on the provision of forest ES. We then suggest directions for future research that can further develop the framework and its use in forest modeling and DSS to better analyze the impact of future developments on forest management and the provision of forest ES at the landscape level.},

  abstract = {The evolution of innovation system literature is scrutinized to delineate the conceptual trends over the past 30\,years. We applied the Sigma index which is supposed to include not only the frontier contributions in the field but also the intellectual bases conveying transformative concepts. Our examination shows that after the establishment of the National Innovation System (NIS) as a principal framework, Regional IS literature emerged as a main branch during the period of 2002–2007, while Technological IS developed as the second main branch from 2007 to 2012. Surprisingly, Sectoral IS has not yet generated a separate constellation, whereas the period after 2012 mainly witnessed the emergence of Triple Helix and Agricultural IS as two new branches. The core of the literature has become classified into persistent intellectual bases (e.g. Lundvall 1992 and Nelson, 1993), diminishing pioneers (e.g. Freeman 1987; Edquist, 1997), emerging works (e.g. Hekkert et al., 2008; Bathelt et al. 2004) and fluctuating others (e.g. Carlsson, 1991; Malerba 2002). Conceptual implications are discussed at the end.},

Critical voices such as the International Council for Science (ICSU), however, have expressed concerns about the potential incompatibility of the SDGs, specifically the incompatibility of socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. In this paper, we test, quantify and model the alleged inconsistency of SDGs. Our analyses show which SDGs are consistent and which are conflicting. We measure the extent of inconsistency and conclude that the SDG agenda will fail as a whole if we continue with business as usual. We further explore the nature of the inconsistencies using dynamical systems models, which reveal that the focus on economic growth and consumption as a means for development underlies the inconsistency. Our models also show that there are factors which can contribute to development (health programmes, government investment) on the one hand and ecological sustainability (renewable energy) on the other, without triggering the conflict between incompatible SDGs.},

These factors are critical determinants of social, economic, and political outcomes. Surveys are not merely a research tool. They are also not only a way of collecting data. Instead, they involve creating the process that will generate the data. This allows the researcher to create their own identifying and controlled variation. Thanks to the rise of mobile technologies and platforms, surveys offer valuable opportunities to study either broadly representative samples or focus on specific groups. This paper offers guidance on the complete survey process, from the design of the questions and experiments to the recruitment of respondents and the collection of data to the analysis of survey responses. It covers issues related to the sampling process, selection and attrition, attention and carelessness, survey question design and measurement, response biases, and survey experiments.},

However, in the twenty-first century, we face scarcity in critical resources, the degradation of ecosystem services, and the erosion of the planet’s capability to absorb our wastes. Equity issues remain stubbornly difficult to solve. This situation is novel in its speed, its global scale and its threat to the resilience of the Earth System. The advent of the Anthropence, the time interval in which human activities now rival global geophysical processes, suggests that we need to fundamentally alter our relationship with the planet we inhabit. Many approaches could be adopted, ranging from geo-engineering solutions that purposefully manipulate parts of the Earth System to becoming active stewards of our own life support system. The Anthropocene is a reminder that the Holocene, during which complex human societies have developed, has been a stable, accommodating environment and is the only state of the Earth System that we know for sure can support contemporary society. The need to achieve effective planetary stewardship is urgent. As we go further into the Anthropocene, we risk driving the Earth System onto a trajectory toward more hostile states from which we cannot easily return.},

  abstract = {Crossing the boundaries in global sustainability                            The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen               et al.               provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.1259855                        ,              Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.                                         RATIONALE               The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).                                         RESULTS               Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).                                         CONCLUSIONS               PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.                                                   Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries.                                        The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO                     2                     concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.                                                                                            ,              The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries—climate change and biosphere integrity—have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.},

  abstract = {We explore the risk that self-reinforcing feedbacks could push the Earth System toward a planetary threshold that, if crossed, could prevent stabilization of the climate at intermediate temperature rises and cause continued warming on a “Hothouse Earth” pathway even as human emissions are reduced. Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

Inspired by early work on biosphere–geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new ‘science of the Earth’. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-change discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System.},

  abstract = {Biomass is projected to play a key role in meeting global climate targets. To achieve a resource-efficient biomass use, European bioeconomy strategies increasingly consider the concept of a circular bioeconomy (CBE). We define the term CBE via a literature review and analyze the concept’s role in north-west European bioeconomy clusters through interviews. We identify strategies regarding the clusters’ feedstock and product focus, and investigate what role biorefineries, circular solutions, recycling and cascading play. Finally, we discuss gaps in CBE literature and the potential contributions of the CBE to sustainability. The analyzed bioeconomy clusters move towards a CBE by increasingly considering residues and wastes as a resource, developing integrated biorefineries and focusing more on material and high value applications of biomass. However, there is so far only little focus on the end-of-life of bio-based products, i.e. on circular product design, recycling and cascading. Key challenges for implementing circular strategies are policies and regulations, costs and the current small size of bio-based markets. Amongst the product sectors the interviewees identified as promising for the bioeconomy, plastics and construction \& building materials have most recycling and cascading potential. While the CBE could contribute to improving the sustainability of the bioeconomy, the concept is not inherently sustainable and its potential trade-offs need to be addressed. Especially social aspects, cascading, circular product design, and aspects related to product use seem to be underrepresented in CBE literature, while the topics biorefinery, wastes and residues as well as waste management are significantly covered.},

  abstract = {From climate change, deforestation, and depletion of fossil fuels to overexploited fisheries, species extinction, and poisons in our food and water, our society is unsustainable and it is getting worse fast. Many advocate that overcoming these problems requires the development of systems thinking. We’ve long been told that the unsustainability of our society arises because we treat the world as unlimited and problems unconnected when we live on a finite “spaceship Earth” in which “there is no away” and “everything is connected to everything else.” The challenge lies in moving from slogans to specific tools and processes that help us understand complexity, design better policies, facilitate individual and organizational learning, and catalyze the technical, economic, social, political and personal changes we need to create a sustainable society. Here I outline a design for a systems science of sustainability that rises to this challenge. Where the dynamics of complex systems are conditioned by multiple feedbacks, time delays, accumulations and nonlinearities, our mental models generally ignore these elements of dynamic complexity; where the consequences of our actions spill out across time and space, across disciplinary and organizational boundaries, our universities, corporations, and governments are organized in silos that focus on the short term and fragment knowledge. I describe how sustainability research, teaching and engagement with the policy process can be organized to provide scientifically grounded, reliable knowledge that crosses disciplinary boundaries, that engages multiple stakeholders, that grapples with unavoidable issues of ethics, values and purpose, and that leads to action.},

Using data collected with an online questionnaire in four European countries, we investigate perceptions related to forest sector innovations on 13 current and new bioeconomy-related products and services. Altogether, 218 valid responses were received in 2015, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics, performance-importance analysis, and Gartner\&rsquo;s innovation hype cycle. Based on our results, the respondents were in the strongest agreement that the forest sector has since the year 2000 has produced innovations related to wood building systems, construction materials, and wood composites. In the next 15 years, they foresaw a decline in innovations related to biofuels and paper products. The European forest sector also has future potential in wood construction, which is likely related to international policy targets related to carbon mitigation and capture. The observed variation in perceptions among the respondents on forest sector innovativeness calls for strengthening industry R\&amp;D, as well as by improving societal awareness of ongoing innovation projects by developing better communication.},

Investments in “clean” innovation and its diffusion are key to shaping this, accompanied by investments in complementary assets including sustainable infrastructure, and human, natural and social capital which will not only help achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve productivity, living standards and the prospects of individuals. In this article, we draw on the theoretical and empirical evidence on the opportunities, drivers and policies for innovation-led sustainable growth. We highlight the importance of a coordinated set of long-term policies and institutions that can enable and foster private sector investments in clean innovation and assets quickly and at scale. In doing so, we draw inspiration from Chris Freeman’s work on the system-wide drivers of innovation, and his early vision of achieving environmental sustainability by reorienting growth.},

  abstract = {This paper sheds light on the state of our knowledge of relationships between plant diversity and tropical forests ecosystem services. We systematically reviewed the empirical evidence of relationships between three ecosystem services: carbon stock and sequestration, timber provisioning and non-timber forest product (NTFP) provisioning, and three dimensions of plant diversity: taxonomic, functional and structural. We carried out meta-analyses to assess their validity across spatial scales and plot sizes. We found that indicators of all three dimensions of plant diversity have reported relationships with at least two of the studied ecosystem services, but there has been limited and inconsistent use of plant diversity indicators and little attention for relationships with timber and NTFP services. Nevertheless, we found that tree species richness showed robust significant positive correlations with carbon stock across the tropics, and that the geographical extent of the study area had a significant negative effect on the strength of this relationship, where the strength of the relationship decreased with increasing geographical extent. This paper reveals a knowledge gap for services other than carbon stock and shows that at local to regional spatial scales, synergies can be achieved between policies focused on biodiversity conservation and maintenance of carbon stocks.},

  abstract = {This chapter examines from systems and livelihood perspectives, with Nemoral and Boreal forest zones of the Global North and Sweden as examples, how forestry may meet current and future sustainability challenges both as a traditional resource base and with respect to other ecosystem services. Previous and current forest policy/governance is briefly described against the background that Swedish forestry is based both on huge holdings by few industrial owners as well as on a multitude of small individual, often family owned, forest estates. Successful delivery against environmental objectives will require careful balancing of interests and the active participation of local forest owners. Cumulative effects of old and new societal demands on forestry and their impact on local livelihoods poses in this respect a systemic risk as economic and social sustainability often gets limited consideration. There is a need for a more synoptic and systemic analysis of how forestry is affected by multiple, partly contradictory, demands from an increasing array of stakeholders, in order to enable a move towards a biobased economy. Stakeholder-based group modelling is a potentially powerful analytic and conflict reducing approach that could help improve forestry’s contribution to the acute need to handle the climate change and current sustainability challenges.},

Within the dominating innovation narratives there are a number of implicit and explicit beliefs that are both descriptive and normative. Technological optimism is the prevailing discourse, challenged by alternative imaginaries, among them a narrative of degrowth. In this paper we argue for the importance of producing more democratic and sustainable imaginations of future social and technological trajectories. We indicate how new narratives for innovation may include different perspectives and sources of knowledge, including heterodox economics, bio-economics, science and technology studies, and Post-Normal Science. The replacement of policy narratives, however, is not achieved through science speaking truth to power. If that were the case, policies would have changed a long time ago. The present analysis and discussion illustrates how the challenge of replacement is itself one that calls for a reflexive understanding of the relationship between knowledge, belief and agency in complex research and innovation (R\&I) systems.},

The analytical approach builds on two theoretical pillars: Multi-level perspective and dynamic capabilities. The findings showed that the incumbent exercised different modes of behavior\&mdash;first-into-niche and follow-into-niche\&mdash;in response to innovation pathways during the transition, mobilizing various dynamic capabilities\&mdash;learning, financing, and organizational restructuring. The study sheds light on the underlying business dynamics of incumbent firms within a given regime and on intra-regime dynamics concerning innovation opportunities, and notes the proactive roles of incumbents in the sustainability transition.},

The topics for the field study were (1) the reasons and amounts of NWFPs harvested by different forest user categories; (2) traditional practices of NWFP use, including harvesting methods and (3) how these practices have changed over the past decades. At the national level, both countries allowed the utilisation of most NWFPs, did not regulate the use, and did not include NWFPs into forest management plans. In both case studies, historical use of NWFPs was intensive. This use remained important in Ukraine, but not in Sweden. Due to difficult economic transition in Ukraine, use of NWFPs by locals has increased. While hunting as a tradition was more popular in the Swedish case study, recreational use of forest was popular in both case studies. Finally, we discuss the role of NWFPs in countries with transition and market economies, and the extent to which the countries support sustainable use of NWFPs.},

One of the most significant research questions in spreading is to rank the spreading ability of nodes in the network. To this end, substantial effort has been made and a variety of effective methods have been proposed. These methods usually define the spreading ability of a node as the number of finally infected nodes given that the spreading is initialized from the node. However, in many real cases such as advertising and news propagation, the spreading only aims to cover a specific group of nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to study the spreading ability of nodes towards localized targets in complex networks. In this paper, we propose a reversed local path algorithm for this problem. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the existing methods in identifying the influential nodes with respect to these localized targets. Moreover, the influential spreaders identified by our method can effectively avoid infecting the non-target nodes in the spreading process.},

  abstract = {Recent research has highlighted the contributions of forests and tree-based systems to both dietary diversity and nutrition as well as agricultural production in the form of tree-based ecosystem services. Wild foods provide a significant nutritional contribution to the diets of rural dwellers, the majority of whom would be classified as some of the world’s poorest. Yet, despite the important human-forest interactions and relative degrees of forest dependency, access to much of the global forest estate is increasingly regulated under the guise of biodiversity conservation. How this restricted access plays out when the “right to food” is a deeply enshrined human right has been deeply contested, particularly with regard to land annexation. This paper outlines the critical issues related to dietary diversity and nutrition in the context of the availability of wild foods juxtaposed with the growing call for the annexation of land for conservation. We suggest that a more integrated and equitable approach to land management that embraces both biodiversity conservation and broader food security and nutrition goals can provide multiple benefits, while mitigating local conflicts. As such, a rights-based approach to conservation and an embracing of broader landscape perspectives are possible strategies to achieve these seemingly conflicting agendas.},

In the boreal, sub-alpine, and alpine regions in Sweden, encompassing 32 million ha, many and different land-use interests overlap, which causes risks for conflict, but potentially also suggests integration and synergy opportunities. Based on geographic information system (GIS) analyses of geographically delineated national interests regulated in the Swedish Environmental Code, including, amongst others, Natura 2000, contiguous mountains, recreation, reindeer husbandry, and wind power, and based on forestry as a dominating land use, we found extensive overlap among similar but also between dissimilar types of interest. In some mountain municipalities, our results show that the designated national interest area is four times as large as the available terrestrial area. Moreover, the overlap is much higher in the alpine than in the boreal biome, and there is increasing designation for nature conservation and a decreasing designation for national interests for culture, recreation, and tourism from south to north. We interpret the results with reference to multiple-use needs and opportunities for landscape approaches to sustainable planning. Departing from biodiversity conservation values, we also discuss opportunities to focus planning strategies on assessing synergy, integration, and conflict based on nature-based and place-based land-use characteristics.},

  abstract = {Data from the Swedish Forest Inventory was used to calculate mass balances for base cations Ca, Mg and K for Swedish forests, Using lysimeter and forest survey soil analyses to estimate present base cation leaching from the root zone reveals that weathering plus base cation deposition is not sufficient to support both, the present base cation leaching rate and the present rate of uptake caused by stem growth. Calculations suggest that 96\% of the productive forested area may have higher rates of removal than supply for one or more base cation. Under a best-case scenario, assuming less pollution, the present growth rare and 100\% efficiency in uptake of available nutrients, the area with more removal than supply would still be at least 30\% of the total area. Forest soils are being depleted at a rate where the exchangeable reservoirs have high risk of being severely depleted in the next few decades in central and southern Sweden. During 1983-1985 the depletion rate is calculated to be, on the average, 0.33 keq ha(-1) year(-1). The weathering rate and present base cation deposition can sustain growth at a level where (80-85) x 10(6)m(3) stemwood year(-1) can be harvested. Any harvested growth beyond this volume must be sustained by artificial means, For whole-tree harvesting without base cation return, the calculations indicate that it would significantly increase the base saturation depletion rate to an average of 0.62 keg ha(-1) year(-1), and risk depletion of the soil in less than one-to-two rotation periods almost anywhere in Sweden. The calculations stress the importance that sustainable forest management must include the management of nutrient fluxes and reservoirs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

To estimate the nutrient sustainability, mass balance was calculated with respect to Ca, Mg, K, N and P. The release from mineral weathering was calculated using the PROFILE model. The leaching has been estimated from observed soil water concentrations and nutrients removed by harvest from projected production. The results indicate that the planned production is on the limits of sustainability and sometimes in excess of it. The stands will overuse Ca, sometimes also Mg, K and P, if all growth is harvested. Soil acidification is still progessing at Bjornstorp Estate, and soil depletion is the result of this. The estimated sustainable yield and the mass balances suggest that the leaching rate is the most uncertain factor for assessing sustainability. Different types of critical loads were investigated, including a new type, based on no excess acidity in the system. The calculations stress the importance of reducing the acid deposition and that nutrient sustainable management must be included in forest management.},

Societies residing in tropical forests alone account for half of the world’s indigenous languages. People have lived in and interacted with forests for thousands of years, both benefiting from their services and influencing the dynamics of the forests in which they live. Forests are therefore most logically viewed as social-ecological systems of which people are an integral component. Forests are globally important because of their broad geographic extent and the great wealth and diversity of ecological services they provide to global and local residents, including substantial biological and cultural diversity.},

  abstract = {Bioeconomy solutions potentially reduce the utilization demand of natural resources, and therefore, represent steps towards circular economy, but are not per se equivalent to sustainability. Thus, production may remain to be achieved against losses in natural resources or at other environmental costs, and materials produced by bioeconomy are not necessarily biodegradable. As a consequence, the assumption that emerging bioeconomy by itself provides an environmentally sustainable economy is not justified, as technologies do not necessarily become sustainable merely through their conversion to using renewable resources for their production. A source of the above assumption is that the utility of bioeconomy is mostly assessed in interaction between technology developers and economists, resulting in biased assessment with private commercial technology benefits being included, but environmental costs, especially longer term ones, not being sufficiently considered in the economic models. A possible solution to this conceptual contradiction may come from bioethics, as a strong concept in environmental ethics is that no technological intervention can be imposed on nature beyond its receptive capacity. To achieve a better balanced analysis of bioeconomy, environmental and ecological, as well as non-economic social aspects, need to be included in the overall assessment.},

The communities found in the Swedish network of innovation are shown to be stable over time and often characterized by strong user-supplier interdependencies. These findings serve to stress how historical imbalances and opportunities are key to understanding the dynamics of the long-run development of industries and new technologies.},

In the empirical section, results from a new micro-based database on Swedish product innovations, 1970–2007, are introduced. Applying the theoretical framework, both quantitative evidence and collected innovation biographies inform of the historical impulses that have shaped innovation activity in the Swedish economy in two broad surges during the 1970s and 1990s. The study shows that, rather than being the result of continuous efforts, most innovations were developed as a response to discrete events, history-specific problems and new technological opportunities. It is also suggested that patterns of creative response are industry-specific and associated with the radicalness and complexity of innovation processes.},

This study examines the network of supply and use of significant innovations across industries in Sweden, 1970-2013. The results suggest that at least 30\% of innovation patterns can be statistically predicted by network stimulus from both backward and forward linkages in the Swedish economy. The network is hierarchical, characterized by hubs that connect diverse industries in closely knitted communities. To account for the structure and evolution of innovation networks, the study proposes a preferential weight assignment process, allowing historical technological linkages and proximities to influence future outcomes. The empirical results show that the properties of the Swedish innovation network are strongly predicted by this process, while skill, knowledge and economic interdependencies have significant but more complex effects on link formation. The results are consistent with the idea that innovations emerge in synergistic communities, but suggest that the transformation of technological systems is shaped by technological requirements, imbalances, and opportunities that are not straightforwardly related to other economic or knowledge proximities.},

This study examines technological transitions in Sweden, 1908–2016, using a new literature-based innovation output indicator for the engineering industry, allowing a mixed-methods approach. The results suggest that waves of innovation have taken place during periods of investment downturns and structural crises during the 1930s, 1970s, and 2010s. Closer examination indicates that landscape pressure alone cannot explain the pattern. Rather, the pattern can be explained by multi-regime interactions: infrastructure and industry rationalization, acting as a fertile ground for breakthrough innovations when the crisis breaks out. The results support a historical interpretation of long-run transitions in terms of development blocks and three industrial revolutions, with implications for the assessment of current sustainable transitions. This suggests a crucial role for infrastructures and interactions between socio-technical systems, not least between digital and renewable energy technology.},

Cities offer spatial economic advantages that boost agglomeration forces and innovation, fostering further concentration of economic activities. For historic reasons urban centers cluster along coasts, which are prone to climate-induced flooding and sea level rise. To explore trade-offs between agglomeration economies and hazards increasing with climate change, we develop an evolutionary agent-based model with heterogeneous boundedly-rational agents who learn and adapt to a changing environment. The model combines migration decision of both households and firms between safe Inland and hazard-prone Coastal regions with endogenous technological learning and economic growth. Flood damages affect Coastal firms hitting their labour productivity, capital stock and inventories. We find that the model is able to replicate a rich set of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning economic and spatial dynamics. Without climate-induced shocks, the model shows how lower transport costs favour the Coastal region fueling the self-reinforcing and path-dependent agglomeration processes. We then introduce five scenarios of floods characterized by different frequency and severity to study the complex interplay of hazards with agglomeration patterns affecting the performance of the overall economy. We find that when shocks are mild or infrequent, they negatively affect the economic performance of the economy. If strong flood hazards hit frequently the Coastal region before agglomeration forces trigger high levels of the waterfront urbanization, firms and households can timely adapt and migrate landwards, thus averting the adverse impacts of climate shocks on the whole economy. Conversely, in the presence of climate tipping points where the frequency and magnitude of flood hazards abruptly intensifies, we find that economic activities remain trapped in the hazard-prone region, generating lock-ins and leading to a harsh downturn of the overall economy.},

Such complexity is not always to the benefit of the accuracy of the forecast. Economic complexity constitutes a framework that builds on methods developed for the study of complex systems to construct approaches that are less demanding than standard macroeconomic ones in terms of data requirements, but whose accuracy remains to be systematically benchmarked. Here we develop a forecasting scheme that is shown to outperform the accuracy of the five-year forecast issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by more than 25\% on the available data. The model is based on effectively representing economic growth as a two-dimensional dynamical system, defined by GDP per capita and ‘fitness’, a variable computed using only publicly available product-level export data. We show that forecasting errors produced by the method are generally predictable and are also uncorrelated to IMF errors, suggesting that our method is extracting information that is complementary to standard approaches. We believe that our findings are of a very general nature and we plan to extend our validations on larger datasets in future works.},

Data collection combined a preliminary interview (n~=~24) with a forest owner survey (n~=~452). We identified four discourses of biodiversity. The concerned discourse acknowledges the biodiversity problems in forests caused by current forestry. The sceptical discourse denies the existence of all biodiversity problems and defends contemporary forestry against the accusations of environmentalists. The harmonising discourse emphasises the harmony of all forest uses in the spirit of multi-objective forestry. The uninvolved discourse distances itself from the biodiversity issue. Overall, only 21\% of the survey respondents worried about biodiversity loss in Finnish forests. The discourses illustrate three different ways in which Finnish forest owners moderate the cognitive dissonance caused by ‘unpleasant’ information on biodiversity loss by either excluding or rejecting it, or assimilating it into multi-objective harmony. Overcoming these kinds of discursive barriers – the mechanisms that help decision-makers ignore alarming realities – is a major challenge for all those who aim to halt biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {There are numerous studies on utilizing a variety of green growth indicators to monitor and assess green growth performance, but there is little research on the influence of a country's green product development on its overall green growth performance. This study uses the concept of the Product Space (PS) network and its main hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth to fill this research gap. The path-dependent economic growth hypothesis argues that countries can grow their economy by increasing the types of products they produce and export, and that these new products should be developed based on countries' existing productive capabilities such as skills, institutions, capital, and technologies. However, recent studies show that countries do not restrict themselves to their existing productive capabilities to develop new products, as they increase human capital endowment and heavily invest in Technological Innovation (TI) to develop new products. The goal of this study is to better understand the relationship between path-dependent economic growth and heavy investment driven growth in the context of green economic performance. We construct a model using Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to investigate the relation of TI and green product development, based on the path-dependent economic growth hypothesis, on Countries' Overall Green Growth Performance (COGGP). The constructed model uses TI and green product empirical data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of 61 countries, including both OECD and non-OECD members, from 2003 to 2015. This study evaluates three hypotheses: the first hypothesis (H1) is confirmed, suggesting that TI has a positive and significant effect on COGGP; the second hypothesis (H2) is not confirmed, in that the results show that TI has a positive and significant impact on Path-Dependent Green Product Development (PDGPD), which is aligned with the concept of the PS network and its main hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth; the third hypothesis (H3) is confirmed, suggesting that PDGPD has a positive and significant effect on COGGP. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence to support the role of TI and the PS network and its hypothesis of path-dependent economic growth in advancing COGGP. Furthermore, the findings indicate that while TI is a crucial factor that fosters COGGP and PDGPD, it is not enough to enable countries to go beyond their existing productive capabilities to produce new green products; therefore, along with productive capabilities, TI is another factor that countries should consider while developing their policy agendas for producing new green products. Based on these findings, this study proposes some policy actions that can be considered by policy makers and researchers to promote green growth in countries around the world.},

  abstract = {When venturing into unfamiliar areas of technology, inventors face ex ante technological uncertainty, that is many possible alternative technological paths going forward and limited guidance from existing technological knowledge for predicting the likelihood that a given path will successfully result in an invention. I theorize, however, that this ex ante technological uncertainty becomes less apparent when evaluating inventions in hindsight. When one knows that a given technological path turned out to be successful ex post, it may be difficult to appreciate the ex ante plausibility of reasons to prefer alternative paths. As a result, inventions may seem more obvious to those evaluating inventions with the benefit of hindsight. My theory yields a counterintuitive implication; when inventors venture into less familiar areas of technology, there is a greater risk of evaluators overestimating obviousness due to hindsight bias. Empirical evidence comes from novel data on accepted and rejected patent applications, including hand-collected data from the text of applicant objections to obviousness rejections and examiners’ subsequent reversals of rejections in response to applicant objections.},

The new holistic perspective of food systems opened a new arena in which narratives competed for attention. This made the FSS an opportunity to develop and discuss alternative transition pathways, brought forward by less powerful voices. However, profound and sustained critique accompanied the Summit and draws a rather dejected picture of its achievements. By analysing how the procedural justice of the FSS is assessed by actor groups proposing different narratives of sustainable food systems, we examine the opportunities and limits of a global governing body like the UN/FAO to foster system change in a procedurally just way.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the transport literature reflects the view that traffic volumes, road traffic volumes in particular, are coupled with Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Recently published literature also argues that the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from transport, passenger cars in particular, have not shown any decoupling from transport volumes for some years. This article presents a theoretical framework for decoupling, defining the difference between decoupling, coupling and negative decoupling. These are further broken down to weak, strong and expansive/recessive degrees of decoupling, laying emphasis on the absolute increase or decrease of the variables. The result section presents data of the development of the relationships between GDP, traffic volumes and CO2 emissions from transport in the EU15 countries between 1970 and 2001, including the special case of Finnish road traffic. The aggregate EU15 data show a change from expansive negative decoupling to expansive coupling regarding passenger transport, and from weak decoupling to expansive negative decoupling regarding freight transport. Weak decoupling of transport CO2 emissions from GDP could also be observed. Weak decoupling of all the three aspects (freight, passenger and CO2) could be seen in the UK, Sweden and Finland in the 1990s. In Finland, the statistics show weak decoupling of GDP from road traffic volume and strong decoupling of road traffic volume and CO2 emissions from road traffic between 1990 and 2001. Four hypothetical explanations of the Finnish phenomenon are put forward in this article: policy towards sustainable mobility, green urban lifestyle, increasing income differences, and statistical misinterpretation. Each explanation is backed up with some quantitative evidence in observable trends in Finland during the 1990s.},

Sustaining forest benefits across the landscape in Arkansas depends on nonindustrial private forest landowners (NIPF) who own 58\% of forestland in the state. Forest certification is an effective “market based” mechanism for improving forest management to achieve sustainability. A mixture of mail and online surveys collected data on Arkansas NIPF landowners' demographic and forestland characteristics, ownership motivations, and attitudes regarding perceived benefits and drawbacks of forest certification. A binary logistic regression model revealed that age, gender, education, timber harvest intentions, motivations for owning forestland, and perspectives regarding the potential benefits of forest certification influenced landowners' awareness and interests in forest certification. These findings provide insight into NIPF landowners' attitudes in participating in a forest certification program. The findings are useful for developing outreach and education programs promoting NIPF landowners' participation in forest certification in Arkansas and other southern states.},

However, given the limited number of representative palaeo-climate datasets from regions of anthropological interest, it has remained challenging to quantify this linkage. Here, we use an unprecedented transient Pleistocene coupled general circulation model simulation in combination with an extensive compilation of fossil and archaeological records to study the spatiotemporal habitat suitability for five hominin species over the past 2 million years. We show that astronomically forced changes in temperature, rainfall and terrestrial net primary production had a major impact on the observed distributions of these species. During the Early Pleistocene, hominins settled primarily in environments with weak orbital-scale climate variability. This behaviour changed substantially after the mid-Pleistocene transition, when archaic humans became global wanderers who adapted to a wide range of spatial climatic gradients. Analysis of the simulated hominin habitat overlap from approximately 300–400 thousand years ago further suggests that antiphased climate disruptions in southern Africa and Eurasia contributed to the evolutionary transformation of Homo heidelbergensis populations into Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, respectively. Our robust numerical simulations of climate-induced habitat changes provide a framework to test hypotheses on our human origin.},

Public stimulation is hence often studied from a relatively restricted and temporarily confined perspective, leaving a macro-level and longer-term perspective unrecognized. This article provides further evidence on the matter by examining how many innovations in Finland and Sweden have been publicly stimulated through funding or research collaboration, over a period of more than four decades (1970–2013). Our main source is a new innovation database constructed following the Literature Based Innovation Output (LBIO) method, which gathers the most significant innovations of both countries for the study period, totalling approximately 4100 Swedish and 2600 Finnish innovations. Our results indicate that the public sector has played a very prominent role in stimulating private innovation in both countries, and with an increasing trend. This is especially true for Finland, where 35–55\% of the innovations of the period have been stimulated by public funding and 25–65\% by collaboration with public research. In Sweden, the share of publicly stimulated innovations has been somewhat lower and erratic, but has increased over time.},

The wide variety of applications has resulted in two key challenges: the generation of many domain-specific strategies for complex systems analyses that are seldom revisited, and the compartmentalization of representation and analysis ideas within a domain due to inconsistency in complex systems language. In this work we propose basic, domain-agnostic language in order to advance toward a more cohesive vocabulary. We use this language to evaluate each step of the complex systems analysis pipeline, beginning with the system under study and data collected, then moving through different mathematical frameworks for encoding the observed data (i.e., graphs, simplicial complexes, and hypergraphs), and relevant computational methods for each framework. At each step we consider different types of dependencies; these are properties of the system that describe how the existence of an interaction among a set of units in a system may affect the possibility of the existence of another relation. We discuss how dependencies may arise and how they may alter the interpretation of results or the entirety of the analysis pipeline. We close with two real-world examples using coauthorship data and email communications data that illustrate how the system under study, the dependencies therein, the research question, and the choice of mathematical representation influence the results. We hope this work can serve as an opportunity for reflection for experienced complex systems scientists, as well as an introductory resource for new researchers.},

Drawing upon a database of 27 European countries, empirical evidence is found for the different roles of supply-side, demandside and regulatory factors in encouraging the adoption of different types of eco-innovation. Our empirical strategy consists of the estimation of a trivariate probit model. Our results show that those entrepreneurs who give importance to collaboration with research institutes, agencies and universities, and to the increase of market demand for green products are more active in all types of eco-innovations. Supply-side factors seem to be a more important driver for environmental processes and organizational innovations than for environmental product innovations. The results also show that market share only has a significant positive influence on eco-product and ecoorganizational innovations, while cost-savings are solely significant for eco-process innovations. Finally, prioritizing existing regulations shapes eco-product and eco-organizational innovations while expected regulations and access to subsidies and fiscal incentives do not have any significant effect on the decision to eco-innovate in Europe at the firm-level.},

  abstract = {Using a dataset of 15 million UK job adverts from a recruitment website, we construct new economic statistics measuring labour market demand. These data are ‘naturally occurring’, having originally been posted online by firms. They offer information on two dimensions of vacancies—region and occupation—that firm-based surveys do not usually, and cannot easily, collect. These data do not come with official classification labels so we develop an algorithm which maps the free form text of job descriptions into standard occupational classification codes. The created vacancy statistics give a plausible, granular picture of UK labour demand and permit the analysis of Beveridge curves and mismatch unemployment at the occupational level.},

  abstract = {Today, climate change and competing land use practices are threatening rangelands around the world and the pastoral societies that rely on them. Reindeer husbandry practised by the indigenous Sami people is an example. In Sweden, approximately 70\% of the most productive lichen pastures (important in winter) has been lost, either completely or because of a reduction in forage quality, as a result of competing land use (primarily commercial forestry). The remaining pastures are small and fragmented. Yet, the number of reindeer in Sweden shows no general decline. We investigated the strategies that have allowed reindeer herders to sustain their traditional livelihood despite a substantial loss of pastures and thus natural winter forage for their reindeer. Changes in harvest strategy and herd structure may partially explain the observed dynamics, and have increased herd productivity and income, but were not primarily adopted to counteract forage loss. The introduction of supplementary feeding, modern machinery, and equipment has assisted the herders to a certain extent. However, supplementary feeding and technology are expensive. In spite of governmental support and optimized herd productivity and income, increasing costs provide low economic return. We suggest that the increased economical and psychosocial costs caused by forage and pasture losses may have strong effects on the long-term sustainability of reindeer husbandry in Sweden.},

However, little is known about how the public perceive it. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire-based survey of the public in Denmark focusing on attitudes toward woody biomass for energy. The main findings are that, while more people favor than oppose it, a large proportion are undecided about the use of woody biomass. The survey also revealed a lack of knowledge about this energy source. A Best-Worst Scaling methodology revealed that Danes prioritize environmental sustainability concerns – namely biodiversity loss, the hindering of the development of other renewable energy sources and the climate change mitigation potential of woody biomass – over societal and/or economic ones when it comes to the promotion of woody biomass. Finally, it was found that concern about climate change, belief in the mitigation potential of woody biomass, and being younger explained the formation of positive attitudes toward woody biomass. Policy makers aiming to take public concerns into account in discussions about Denmark's energy future should focus more on minimizing the negative environmental impacts associated with woody biomass rather than on its economic benefits.},

It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent market and policy failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages. The notion of a Techno-Institutional Complex is introduced to capture the idea that lock-in occurs through combined interactions among technological systems and governing institutions. While carbon lock-in provides a conceptual basis for understanding macro-level barriers to the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies, it also generates questions for standard economic modeling approaches that abstract away technological and institutional evolution in their elaboration. The question of escaping carbon lock-in is left for a future paper.},

This article aims to create such link by combining insights from innovation systems (IS) research and transformative sustainability science. For a knowledge-based bioeconomy to successfully contribute to sustainability transformations, the IS\&rsquo; focus must be broadened beyond techno-economic knowledge. We propose to also include systems knowledge, normative knowledge, and transformative knowledge in research and policy frameworks for a sustainable knowledge-based bioeconomy (SKBBE). An exploration of the characteristics of this extended, \&ldquo;dedicated\&rdquo; knowledge will eventually aid policymakers in formulating more informed transformation strategies.},

Four dimensions of the bioeconomy visions were identified: "drivers vs barriers", "change in technology vs lifestyles", "biological vs any sustainable resources" and "change as sustainable vs risky". The quantitative survey of Finnish citizens (N\,=\,1020) was analysed with exploratory factor analysis and linear regression. Five dimensions emerged: "bio-based resources", "social and economic sustainability", "environmental degradation", "non-material values" and "scientific and technological advancement". The majority of respondents imagined a moderate increase in the use of bio-based resources and the scientific and technological advancement. The majority imagined no change in the social and economic sustainability and non-material values. The respondents were divided rather equally into those who imagined environmental degradation to worsen, those who imagined it to improve, and those who imagined it to stay the same. These findings demonstrate that citizens and future environmental professionals are critical of the environmental sustainability of bioeconomy, and that they perceive lifestyle changes and non-material values as a part of bioeconomy, which are not currently captured by official bioeconomy policies.},

A multi-stage process was introduced and employed to develop and to validate the index. Statistical population of the study consisted of Iranian wheat farmers. The related data were analyzed using various multivariate statistical methods i.e. principal component factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Principal component factor analysis classified agricultural sustainability measurement indicators into four factors/criteria including “social equity and well-being”, “durability”, “stability and compatibility”, and “productivity and efficiency”. Factor structure of agricultural sustainability measurement index was then subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and fit indices of the model proved the measurement structure of index. Finally, 23 main indicators were introduced to measure agricultural sustainability. And the validity and reliability of the instrument were tested. Regarding the challenges of researchers, decision-makers and policymakers in improving and attaining agricultural sustainability, agricultural sustainability measurement index developed and validated in this study and its processes might be useful in directing/redirecting agricultural policies, rational comparison of different regions in terms of agricultural sustainability, and facilitating interventions. Besides, regarding that the index has been validated in Iran (a region with different climatic variations), that might be used for wider geographic range limits and climatic zones.},

At the start, and triggered by waves of social revolts, there is a positive feedback mechanism between increasing freedom, growing factor markets, and economic growth. After two or three centuries, as a result of increasing economic inequality and the rise of new market elites, this turns into a negative feedback mechanism, between social polarization, institutional sclerosis, markets becoming skewed towards the interests of the market elites, and economic growth stagnating or even turning into decline. Possible counterbalancing mechanisms, including those offered by the state, prove futile. The market elites acquire a grip over state power and use this to further skew the markets to their interests, thus speeding up the process. No correction mechanism is available to counter the negative feedback cycle.},

  abstract = {The book offers a radical departure from the conventional wisdom of economists and economic historians by showing that factor markets and the economies dominated by them—the market economies—are not modern, but existed at various times in the past. They are not always rising, but after some time they stagnate and decline again. They are not uniform, but consist of very different combinations of institutions embedded in very different societies. They create flexibility and high mobility in the exchange of land, labour, and capital, and initially they generate economic growth, although they also build on the growth already generated by these societies in the previous period using other exchange and allocation systems. The dynamism that results from the rise of factor markets leads to the rise of new market elites who accumulate land and capital and use wage labour extensively to make their wealth profitable. In the long run this creates social polarization and a decline of average welfare. As these new elites gradually translate their economic wealth into political leverage, it also creates institutional sclerosis, and makes these markets stagnate or decline again. This process is analysed for the three major, pre-industrial examples of successful market economies in western Eurasia: Iraq in the early Middle Ages, Italy in the high Middle Ages, and the Low Countries in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, and more succinctly for England and the United States in the modern period.},

Within the resulting highly monetized and market-oriented setting, inequality started to rise. A new, wealthy elite came to the fore, which combined large landholding with financial dealings. By advancing cash to the state and acquiring a pivotal role within the tax system, this elite found opportunities to strengthen its political role. Gradually, the focus of the market elites shifted to the political sphere, and to developing instruments of coercion, rather than investing in the economy. As other people had no means for investment, due to the unequal distribution of wealth, and markets became skewed to the interests of the elite, the economy of Iraq in the tenth century started to fall again.},

  abstract = {Many parts of the Low Countries were characterized by a large degree of freedom, and this was further expanded in the eleventh to thirteenth century, in a wave of revolts and self-organization by ordinary people. Old, feudal blockades were removed and markets for land, lease, and labour grew, followed by credit markets. By the sixteenth century, these well-organized, open markets had become dominant. This generated economic growth, but also gave rise to a new economic elite of merchant entrepreneurs, who extended their wealth in a society increasingly characterized by economic inequality. This was most pronounced in Holland, where the Golden Age saw these elites translate their wealth into political leverage, through financing the public debt, buying shares in the Dutch East India Company, supplying finances for the military and acquiring administrative positions. Their dominance made the economy and markets less open, and the economy began to stagnate.},

Land and lease markets sprang up. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, these were used by townsmen to expand their rural landholdings and to make them profitable through a type of sharecropping, mezzadria, in which the tenants retained almost no economic agency. The urban elites further expanded their wealth through their dealings in the developing capital markets. This enabled them to secure a hold on the heavily indebted city-states and, next, to use their political leverage to further strengthen their hold over land, capital, and labour, in part by coercion. At the same time, after a long period of florescence, the economy declined again.},

We compare these two countries because of their historically weak domestic offshore wind markets, long legacies in the oil and gas (O\&G) and maritime industries and active participation in the growing offshore wind market. Our analysis is informed by the technological innovation systems framework and context conditions and we derive our results from nearly 60 interviews with key stakeholders in both countries. Our results point to three main empirical findings: 1) The Netherlands focused much more on explicit innovation system building strategies than Norway; 2) O\&G is a critical sectoral and political context condition with a profound impact on offshore wind in both countries: in Norway, O\&G price shocks led to fluctuating offshore wind participation; in the Netherlands, offshore O\&G has been on a decline since the early 2000s, leading to a constant pressure to diversify. 3) The Netherlands had closer industrial proximity alignment than Norway, leading to stronger innovation system emergence and industrial participation. We highlight three theoretical contributions: 1) Certain context conditions – in our case O\&G sectoral and political contexts – play a stronger role than others in influencing TIS emergence; 2) Context conditions strongly overlap. The political and sectoral O\&G context is intimately linked; 3) Contexts are not static. As context conditions evolve overtime, so do their effects on the innovation system.},

Notwithstanding the substantial advantages, the eligibility of LBIO data for innovation research remains controversial. In this paper the merits of LBIO data are examined by means of comparative analysis. A newly built LBIO database is systematically compared with the widely used Community Innovation Survey. It shows that both databases identify similar innovators in terms of firm size, distribution across industries and degree of innovativeness: LBIO data can be considered a fully fledged alternative to traditional innovation data, highly eligible for innovation research.},

  abstract = {The transition towards a circular economy requires a systemic change, where regions play a vital role. In Finland’s Päijät-Häme region, European and national targets for a circular economy were implemented on a regional level. The regional development programme and strategy of the area emphasises a circular economy as a key feature. In practice, a circular economy strategy was set up through a road map process involving stakeholders from local government, industry and academia. The strategy aims to strengthen circular economy implementation in real-world systems through five identified goals. The goals focus on closing both technical and biological loops, as well as promoting sustainable energy technologies, new consumption models and demonstration sites. This paper illustrates how a move towards a circular economy is supported through regional strategy implementation. Furthermore, opportunities and challenges related to the transition towards the circular economy are presented via a case analysis of a local bio-based industrial symbiosis where biogas and fertiliser are produced from biowaste streams and sewage sludge. New technologies such as these create more business opportunities at the interface of material and energy cycles even where their implementation faces financing challenges. Regulations need to support the implementation of effective symbioses emerging from new solutions, but are also needed to safeguard the environment and human health when closing biological loops. The regional circular economy strategy described and the case of bio-based industrial symbiosis are both recognised as transferable good practices at the European level. A stakeholder-based approach is shown to be crucial to continuous development towards a circular economy society.},

Hal Varian (born 1947) is widely known by professional economists for his pathbreaking work in the economics of information and networks. Many more know him as the author of two bestselling microeconomics textbooks, one written for undergraduate college students and one designed for advanced graduate students. Through his research and his books, Professor Varian’s ideas have influenced a generation of economists. In this paper, Professor Varian outlines how he approaches the task of building an economic model to explain an observed phenomena or solve a problem. His words are encouraging advice for graduate students and young economists learning how to “practice the art” of economics. Professor Varian offers a number of tips ranging from how to choose a topic, when to read the literature, and even to how to effectively manage your bibliographic citations. Professor Varian’s advice has passed the market test as this paper remains one of the most referenced and downloaded papers in The American Economist’s backfile. However, after including the paper on a course reading list several years ago, one doctoral student pointed out to this editor that Professor Varian fails to explain how to find the “spare time” that he references in the title!},

The main question studied in this paper is whether forest carbon sequestration is worth increasing at the expense of bioenergy and forest products to achieve the EU emissions reduction target for 2050 in a cost-efficient manner. A dynamic cost minimisation model is used to find the optimal combination of carbon abatement strategies to meet annual emissions targets between 2010 and 2050. The results indicate that forest carbon sequestration is a low-cost abatement method. With sequestration, the net present costs of meeting EU carbon targets can be reduced by 23\%.},

Our main goal is to review Bioeconomy’s “state of the art” in this region as well as some perspectives for future development and potential of sub utilized products to be included in the Bioeconomy agenda. Additionally, we have considered that Central America should hold and promote its potential for natural resource supply, such as water and biodiversity. Natural resources enable the region to provide ecosystem services to face food insecurity and develop adapted technologies for climate change. Food and biomass production are clear examples of this potential, nonetheless a re-orientation of the region’s economy (and policies) is needed.},

Beside this debate, the political importance of de- and re-linking necessitates some test to determine whether environmental stress moves into a desired direction or not. The aim of this article is to analyze this important question. For this purpose, we present a theoretical framework including some new concepts of the de-linking and re-linking process as well as the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. The main contribution of this article is to operationalize the new theoretical framework for the first time and to analyze the phenomenon of de-linking and re-linking in some of the most important industrialized and developing countries with two indicators of environmental stress. In the case of total primary energy supply, the general global trend in 1973-1999 seems to be weak de-linking. In the case of CO2 emissions, the EU shows strong de-linking in 1973-1999, Japan, USA and China weak de-linking and India and Brazil expansive re-linking. On the basis of this study, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis seems to gain some support for CO2 emissions and total primary energy supply, both in the industrialized and developing countries.},

  abstract = {Land use and land cover data play a central role in climate change assessments. These data originate from different sources and inventory techniques. Each source of land use/cover data has its own domain of applicability and quality standards. Often data are selected without explicitly considering the suitability of the data for the specific application, the bias originating from data inventory and aggregation, and the effects of the uncertainty in the data on the results of the assessment. Uncertainties due to data selection and handling can be in the same order of magnitude as uncertainties related to the representation of the processes under investigation. While acknowledging the differences in data sources and the causes of inconsistencies, several methods have been developed to optimally extract information from the data and document the uncertainties. These methods include data integration, improved validation techniques and harmonization of classification systems. Based on the data needs of global change studies and the data availability, recommendations are formulated aimed at optimal use of current data and focused efforts for additional data collection. These include: improved documentation using classification systems for land use/cover data; careful selection of data given the specific application and the use of appropriate scaling and aggregation methods. In addition, the data availability may be improved by the combination of different data sources to optimize information content while collection of additional data must focus on validation of available data sets and improved coverage of regions and land cover types with a high level of uncertainty. Specific attention in data collection should be given to the representation of land management (systems) and mosaic landscapes.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the notion of convivial technology as a conceptual framework for technologies suitable for degrowth societies. This paper is inspired by Ivan Illich's notion of convivial tools but reconsiders it in the light of current practices and discussions. Looking for a definition of convivial technologies it uses qualitative empirical research conducted with degrowth-oriented groups developing or adapting grassroots technologies like Open Source cargo bikes or composting toilets in Germany. The basic ethical values and design criteria that guide these different groups in relation to technology are summed up into five dimensions: relatedness, adaptability, accessibility, bio-interaction and appropriateness. These dimensions can be correlated with the four life-cycle levels material, production, use and infrastructure to form the Matrix for Convivial Technology (MCT). The MCT is a 20-field schema that can be filled in. Experiences with the tool in different fields are presented. The MCT is itself a convivial tool as it allows for degrowth-oriented groups to self-assess their work and products in a qualitative, contextsensitive and independent way. It is a normative schema that fosters discussion concerning degrowth technologies in contexts of political education. And it is a research method as it helps collecting data about underlying ethical assumptions and aspirations of individuals and groups engaged in developing technology.},

  abstract = {Concern exists that public funding of science is increasingly risk averse. Funders have addressed this concern by soliciting the submission of high-risk research to either regular or specially designed programs. Little evidence, however, has been gathered to examine the extent to which such programs and initiatives accomplish their stated goal. This paper sets out to study this using data from the European Research Council (ERC), a program within the EC, established in 2007 to support high-risk/high-gain research. We examine whether the ERC selected researchers with a track record of conducting risky research. We proxy high-risk by a measure of novelty in the publication records of applicants both before and after the application, recognizing that it is but one dimension of risk. We control and interact the risk measure with high-gain by tracking whether the applicant has one or more top 1\% highly cited papers in their field. We find that applicants with a history of risky research are less likely to be selected for funding than those without such a history, especially early career applicants. This selection penalty for high-risk also holds among those applicants with a history of high-gain publications. To test whether receiving a long and generous prestigious ERC grant promotes risk taking, we employ a diff-in-diff approach. We find no evidence of a significant positive risk treatment effect for advanced grantees. Only for early career grantees do we find that recipients are more likely to engage in risky research, but only compared to applicants who are unsuccessful at the second stage. This positive treatment effect is in part due to unsuccessful applicants cutting back on risky research. We cautiously interpret this as a “lesson learned” that risk is not rewarded.},

Whether new capital complements skilled or unskilled labour may be determined endogenously by innovators’ economic incentives shaped by relative prices, the size of the market, and institutions.

However, not much is known about factors that shape self-esteem and its development in the second half of life and whether the factors differ with age and gender. To examine these questions, this study uses 2-wave data from the population-based NorLAG study in Norway (N = 5,555; Mage = 58 years; 51\% women) and combines self-report data on self-esteem and personality with registry-based information on socioeconomic status (education, income, unemployment), health problems (sick leave, lifetime history of disability), and social relationships (cohabiting partner, lifetime history of divorce and widowhood). Results from latent change score models revealed that self-esteem peaked at around age 50 and declined thereafter. More importantly, lower socioeconomic status, not having a cohabiting partner, unemployment, and disability were each uniquely associated with lower levels of self-esteem and/or steeper declines in self-esteem over the 5-year study period. Over and above registry-based information, personality characteristics were relevant, with a more mature personality being associated with higher self-esteem level. Emotionally stable participants also showed less pronounced declines in self-esteem. Moreover, associations of disability and of emotional stability with self-esteem level were weaker with advancing age. Among women, self-esteem level was more strongly associated with emotional stability and less strongly with openness, compared to men. Our findings demonstrate the utility of registry-based information and suggest that physical health, social relationships, and personality factors are in manifold ways uniquely associated with self-esteem and its development later in life.

However, green water lacks explicit consideration in the existing planetary boundaries framework that demarcates a global safe operating space for humanity. In this Perspective, we propose a green water planetary boundary and estimate its current status. The green water planetary boundary can be represented by the percentage of ice-free land area on which root-zone soil moisture deviates from Holocene variability for any month of the year. Provisional estimates of departures from Holocene-like conditions, alongside evidence of widespread deterioration in Earth system functioning, indicate that the green water planetary boundary is already transgressed. Moving forward, research needs to address and account for the role of root-zone soil moisture for Earth system resilience in view of ecohydrological, hydroclimatic and sociohydrological interactions. The planetary boundaries framework outlines a safe operating space for humanity according to key Earth system dynamics. This Perspective proposes the addition of a green water planetary boundary based on root-zone soil moisture and demonstrates that widespread green water modifications now present increasing risks to Earth system resilience.},

Yet, despite an early setback, individuals with near misses systematically outperform those with narrow wins in the longer run. Moreover, this performance advantage seems to go beyond a screening mechanism, suggesting early-career setback appears to cause a performance improvement among those who persevere.

However, if the ecological footprint cannot be controlled at the same time, economic growth will not be maintained. This work takes 166 countries (divided into high-income countries, upper-middle-income countries, lower-middle-income countries, and low-income countries) as examples to analyze the nexus between renewable energy consumption, population aging, and decoupling economic growth from ecological footprint. This study uses the second-generation econometric methodological framework of panel data to effectively solve the problems of transnational heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence. The results indicate that the decoupling between economic growth and ecological footprint showed an improvement trend from 1990 to 2015, and finally maintained a weak decoupling. Among them, upper-middle income countries improved the earliest (2003), and low-income countries improved the latest (2009). The evidence of the inverted U-shaped nexus between economic growth and ecological footprint shows the validity of the Ecological Kuznets Curve globally. However, this nexus is not significant in low-income countries. Importantly, renewable energy consumption can reduce the ecological footprint globally in the long run. Furthermore, this reduce effect is stronger in low income and lower-middle income countries than in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. Population aging, financial development and trade openness all contribute to the reduction of the ecological footprint. Among them, the effect of population aging is more significant than financial development and trade openness. Based on the results, comprehensive policy implications were put forward so that these countries can achieve the decoupling economic growth from ecological footprint.},

New tools continue to be developed and used to analyse our personal connections, with particular emphasis on detecting communities or identifying key individuals in a social network. This raises privacy concerns that are likely to exacerbate in the future. With this in mind, we ask the question ‘Can individuals or groups actively manage their connections to evade social network analysis tools?’ By addressing this question, the general public may better protect their privacy, oppressed activist groups may better conceal their existence and security agencies may better understand how terrorists escape detection. We first study how an individual can evade ‘node centrality’ analysis while minimizing the negative impact that this may have on his or her influence. We prove that an optimal solution to this problem is difficult to compute. Despite this hardness, we demonstrate how even a simple heuristic, whereby attention is restricted to the individual’s immediate neighbourhood, can be surprisingly effective in practice; for example, it could easily disguise Mohamed Atta’s leading position within the World Trade Center terrorist network. We also study how a community can increase the likelihood of being overlooked by community-detection algorithms. We propose a measure of concealment—expressing how well a community is hidden—and use it to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple heuristic, whereby members of the community either ‘unfriend’ certain other members or ‘befriend’ some non-members in a coordinated effort to camouflage their community.},

We argue that both problems and solutions can be divergent (contested, complex, and uncertain) or convergent (uncontested, well-defined, and informed). Based on the resulting problem–solution typology, we suggest a process-oriented view on MIP and discuss three alternative pathways along which convergence between problems and solutions can be achieved to come from wicked problems to legitimate solutions. We illustrate these pathways using examples for different societal problems related to health (smoking bans), security (CCTV), and energy (wind turbines). For policy makers, locating a societal challenge in this problem–solution space, and implementing policy strategies to achieve problem and solution convergence, is expected to accelerate both the legitimacy of a mission and the resulting solutions.},

This begs the question about subsidiarity: what innovation policies for societal challenges should be organized at subnational, national and supranational levels? We provide arguments that innovation policies aimed to solve societal challenges, such as climate change or aging, are best pursued at subnational levels given the contested nature of problem identification and the contextual nature of problem-solving. Regional innovation policy, then, should formulate concrete societal goals tailored to the local context, while the transnational context promotes inter-regional learning and provides the complementary policies in the realms of basic research, regulation and taxation. In addition, the supranational level can set overall goals that are made more concrete and operational at the subnational level.},

  abstract = {The recent policy debates about orientating research, technology and innovation policy towards societal challenges, rather than economic growth objectives only, call for new lines of argumentation to systematically legitimize policy interventions. While the multi-level perspective on long-term transitions has attracted quite some interest over the past years as a framework for dealing with long-term processes of transformative change, but the innovation systems approach is still the dominant perspective for devising innovation policy. Innovation systems approaches stress the importance of improving innovation capabilities of firms and the institutional settings to support them, but they are less suited for dealing with the strategic challenges of transforming systems of innovation, production and consumption, and thus with long-term challenges such as climate change or resource depletion. It is therefore suggested to consider insights from transition studies more prominently in a policy framework that is based on the innovation systems approach and the associated notion of ‘failures’. We propose a comprehensive framework that allows legitimizing and devising policies for transformative change that draws on a combination of market failures, structural system failures and transformational system failures.},

The chapter particularly discusses the spatial and sectoral aspects that are of relevance: not only the production systems within forestry – and partly in the forest-based sector – have a territorial dimension, but also the related innovation processes and innovation systems. Specific sectoral aspects relate to the character of the forest-based industries as a traditional sector, and the fact that small enterprises play an important role in the sectoral production.},

  abstract = {Forest ownership is changing in Europe. Reasons include recent institutional changes in Eastern Europe, changing lifestyles of non-agricultural owners and afforestation. At present, there is little comparative analysis across Europe, and the implications that these changes have for forest management and for the fulfilment and redefinition of policy objectives have not been addressed systematically. This paper has been developed in the framework of a European research network on forest ownership change, based on conceptual work, literature reviews and empirical evidence from 28 European countries. It aims to provide an overview of the state of knowledge, to discuss relevant issues and provide conceptual and practical foundations for future research, forest management approaches, and policy making. In particular, it discusses possible approaches for classifying forest ownership types and understandings of “new” forest ownership. One important insight is that the division into public and private forests is not as clear as often assumed and that an additional category of semi-public (or semi-private) forms of forest ownership would be desirable. Another recommendation is that the concepts of “new forest owners” vs. “new forest owner types” should be differentiated more consciously. We observe that, in research and policy practice, the mutual relations between forest ownership structure and policies are often neglected, for instance, how policies may directly and indirectly influence ownership development, and what different ownership categories mean for the fulfilment of policy goals. Finally, we propose that better support should be provided for the development of new, adapted forest management approaches for emerging forest owner types. Forest ownership deserves greater attention in studies dealing with forest policy or forest management.},

Overall, the established concepts and approaches from innovation research are well received in forest sector innovation studies, although newer trends could be taken up more progressively. The analysed articles apply various quantitative and qualitative methods and are dominated by country and (sub-)sectoral case studies.

  abstract = {Innovation in the forest sector is a growing research interest and within this field, there is a growing attention for institutional, policy and societal dimensions and particular when it comes to the question of how to support innovativeness in the sector. This Special Issue therefore focuses on governance aspects, relating to and bridging business and political-institutional-societal levels. This includes social/societal factors, goals and implications that have recently been studied under the label of social innovation. Furthermore, the emergence of bioeconomy as a paradigm and policy goal has become a driver for a variety of innovation processes on company and institutional levels. Our article provides a tentative definition of “innovation governance” and attempts a state-of-art review of innovation governance research in the forest sector. For structuring the research field, we propose to distinguish between organizational/managerial, policy or innovation studies. For the forestry sector, specifically, we suggest to distinguish between studies focusing on (i) innovative governance of forest management and forest goods and services; on (ii) the governance of innovation processes as such, or (iii) on specific (transformational) approaches that may be derived from combined goals such as innovation governance for sustainability, regional development, or a bioeconomy. Studies in the forest sector are picking up new trends from innovation research that increasingly include the role of societal changes and various stakeholders such as civil society organizations and users. They also include public-private partnership models or participatory governance. We finally should not only look in how far research approaches from outside are applied in the sector but we believe that the sector could contribute much more to our general scientific knowledge on ways for a societal transformation to sustainability.},

Our results depict an increasing number of innovation articles with positive sentiment until 2015. More recently, we observe a decrease in innovation articles. Along with the decreasing ICE sales and performance data, this weakening support of the media for the TIS innovation output suggests a possible misalignment with collective expectations that could lead to a vicious decline cycle. Our study offers a real-time indicator for monitoring innovation strategies and develops a methodological framework to derive technology-specific innovation indicators on the firm-level using unsupervised topic modelling and sentiment analysis.},

However, these forests are threatened by illegal logging for wood products and encroachment for crop farming. A study was conducted in villages surrounding five forest fragments to establish the conservation programmes responsible for keeping these forests intact for provision of goods and services to the local communities. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 250 respondents in 25 villages surrounding the five forest fragments. Twenty-five focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with key informants actively involved in conservation activities. Results showed that the Taita community conserves the forest fragments through management practices that integrate livelihood needs in conservation, such as butterfly farming, bee-keeping and ecotourism. Additionally, community tree nurseries have been established to produce seedlings for restoring degraded areas, and agroforestry belts have been established on the forests’ edges to provide wood products and protect the forests from encroachment. Likewise, village committees have been established to oversee conservation activities inside the village jurisdictional area. The integrated conservation and livelihood approach has reduced forest destruction, enhanced landscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation, increased incomes, enhanced capacity of the community to adapt to climate change, improved food security, enhanced carbon storage, strengthened traditional knowledge and practices, and ensured availability of clean water for the local population.},

The paper shows that radical technology innovations in the vehicle itself are achieved by underlying principles that focus on mass decompounding, powertrain de-coupling, whole system design, and low-volume production systems. The characteristics of the technologies are fundamental to, and in part derive from, the business model adopted by the case, and the governance structures designed to avoid the primacy usually afforded to returns to financial shareholders. While the case is embryonic, the paper argues that an important possible contribution is the ability to commence a disruptive transition to a degrowth future from within existing legal frameworks, social practices, cultural expectations and physical infrastructures.},

  abstract = {A transition towards a bio-based economy is accompanied by a growing demand for biomass resources as fossil fuels need to be replaced for the more sustainable production of consumer goods, chemicals and energy. To increase the supply of renewable biomass and avoid a conflict with food production, currently underutilized by-products (i.e. leaves, stems) from horticultural production could be valorised as feedstock. The success of this approach depends on farmers' willingness to adopt novel practices like the collection and treatment of plant leaves. However, literature on factors influencing farmers' decisions to adopt novel practices aimed to foster the Bioeconomy is limited. This paper addresses this gap by exploring drivers of farmers' interest in the valorisation of by-products. To this aim, the Value-Belief-Norm theory was used and expanded by contextual factors, such as the perceived market demand for biomass and future environmental policies. A survey with German fruit and vegetable farmers (N = 96) has been carried out and data have been analysed with a Structural Equation Model. Findings suggest that the Value-Belief-Norm theory is a relevant framework for the agricultural domain to predict farmers' interest in the valorisation of horticultural by-products. Results further indicate that an internal ecological worldview is potentially relevant for farmers' perception of contextual conditions aimed to foster the Bioeconomy. These outcomes could have managerial and policy implications associated with the identification of potential lead users to trigger the diffusion of innovative sustainable practices and generally foster the Bioeconomy.},

Social innovation is a complex process that profoundly changes the basic routines, resource and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which it occurs. Various applications of marketing and diffusion theory are helpful to some extent in understanding the trajectories or successful strategies associated with social innovation. It seems unwise, however, to rely solely on a market model to understand the dynamics of scaling social innovation, in view of the complex nature of the supply-demand relation with respect to the social innovation market. Instead, the authors propose a distinctive model of system transformation associated with a small but important group of social innovations and dependent on discontinuous and cross-scale change. This paper focuses on the challenge of scaling up social innovations in general and in particular the dynamics of going to scale.},

The instruments are called systemic in the expectation that they will improve the functioning of entire (innovation) systems. A first step in designing systemic instruments is an analysis of the systemic problems that hinder the development of a specific technological trajectory. This paper argues that two approaches to studying innovation systems—structural and functional analyses—can be combined in a systemic policy framework that helps to first, identify the systemic problems; and second, to suggest the systemic instruments that would address these problems.},

  abstract = {The emerging academic field focused on sustainability has been engaged in a rich and converging debate to define what key competencies are considered critical for graduating students to possess. For more than a decade, sustainability courses have been developed and taught in higher education, yet comprehensive academic programs in sustainability, on the undergraduate and graduate level, have emerged only over the last few years. Considering this recent institutional momentum, the time is seemingly right to synthesize the discussion about key competencies in sustainability in order to support these relatively young academic programs in shaping their profiles and achieving their ambitious missions. This article presents the results of a broad literature review. The review identifies the relevant literature on key competencies in sustainability; synthesizes the substantive contributions in a coherent framework of sustainability research and problem-solving competence; and addresses critical gaps in the conceptualization of key competencies in sustainability. Insights from this study lay the groundwork for institutional advancements in designing and revising academic programs; teaching and learning evaluations; as well as hiring and training faculty and staff.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

In this paper, we assess the state and prospects of forest ecosystem services provision in Europe, introducing new data from the European collaborative research projects SINCERE, NOBEL and CLEARING HOUSE, and combining it with findings from the literature. We identify six challenges (1 an insufficient alignment of FES supply and demand, 2 lacking policy integration, 3 ambiguous and conflicting regulatory frameworks, 4 a lack of precise information on FES demand and provision, and innovations to align both, 5 an increasing pressure to adapt to climate change, and 6 a striking diversity constraining European level policy solutions) and three opportunities (1 increasingly heterogenous forest owner objectives potentially matching pluralistic societal demands, 2 diversifying forest enterprises levering innovations in regulating and cultural ecosystem services provision, and 3 the potential of forests to mitigate climate change). Subsequently, we introduce four distinct but complimentary policy pathways for European forest policy to better align forest ecosystem services provision and demand: 1 Better monitoring of FES supply and demand, 2 Enhanced policy integration, 3 Payments for ecosystem services, and 4 Bottom-up participation and learning among ecosystem services innovators. We conclude by emphasizing the momentum that the EU Green Deal unfolds for a future European forest policy to incentivise the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Academic research and policy have focused on sustainable energy transitions for addressing the societal challenge of climate change for a long time, but the concept of ‘social innovation’ has only been recently taken up. This concept refers to different social phenomena relating to changes in socio-technical systems. Moving beyond narrow perspectives on social innovation, this article asks how we can capture the diversity of social innovation, taking the example of the energy sector. It proposes a comprehensive typology of social innovation that allows to capture the phenomenon in its empirical diversity, and to more systematically investigate processes of social innovation and their contributions to making socio-technical systems more sustainable. The typology is based on a conceptual understanding of social innovation in energy (SIE) as comprising changing social relations involving new ways of doing, thinking and/or organising energy. It is empirically grounded in mapping and analysing 500 SIE-initiatives across eight European countries. Such a conceptually-informed and empirically-grounded understanding of SIE sheds light on the ‘social’ as an object of innovation, the agency of a multitude of actors, and the different types of social relations and activities pursued by energy system actors. It also opens the possibility to publicly discuss the diverse social innovations and their interdependencies, (un)desirability, as well as transformative potentials in energy transitions.},

  abstract = {The bioeconomy is expected to be a key solution to supply societies with food and non-food products while replacing non-renewable resources and preserving natural ones. Sustainability of bioeconomy systems is currently an issue that has to be addressed. Current research dealing with the bioeconomy focuses primarily on technologies to improve biomass transformation and, with regard to sustainability, on simple and unitary bio-based value chains such as biofuel production from a single crop. In this paper, based on a literature review, we highlight the complexity of bioeconomy systems and propose a framework to support their sustainable development. We first review the key characteristics of bioeconomy systems: a wide variety of stakeholders with a limited vision of bioeconomy systems, flexibility but also rigidity of biomass feedstocks or transformation processes and a complex spatio-temporal layout. Drawing on sustainability science, we show the relevance of the social-ecological concept to approach territorial bioeconomy systems' sustainably and develop an analytical framework to address sustainable development of territorial (local/regional) bioeconomy systems. This framework is based on two complementary representations of territorial bioeconomy systems, used to decipher their complexity. Finally, we outline an integrated assessment and modelling approach designed to tackle specific bioeconomy sustainability issues. This participatory approach has to take into account: i) the different sub-systems of territorial bioeconomy systems, their high level of interactions, their heterogeneity in terms of entities and processes involved and the circularity of matter and energy (production, transformation, use and recycling) with particular emphasis on the transformation sub-system and the logistics ii) the multiplicity and flexibility of stakeholders’ nature, strategies and concerns, iii) the variety of spatial and temporal scales at play; iv) the effects of exogenous drivers like supra-regional policies and regulations, markets (e.g. prices of energies and biomass-based products) and climate.},

However, research about dynamic changes of SDG interactions is limited, and how they change as sustainable development progresses remains elusive. Here, we used a correlational network approach and a global SDG database of 166 countries to analyse the evolution of SDG interactions along a progression of sustainable development measured by the SDG Index. SDG interactions showed nonlinear changes as the SDG Index increased: SDGs were both more positively and more negatively connected at low and high sustainable development levels, but they were clustered into more isolated positive connection groups at middle levels. The identification of a process of decoupling followed by re-coupling along the SDG Index strengthens our understanding of sustainable development and may help to suggest action priorities to achieve as many SDGs as possible by 2030.},

  abstract = {Boreal forest nations are often thought to have similar environmental, social, and economic contexts. In this communication we show that boreal forest nations are a disparate grouping, with some similarities and many differences. Highlighting these differing national contexts provides insights into how a given nation utilizes the boreal forests over which it holds stewardship responsibilities. Current national contexts are related to each nation's physiography, climate, history, legacy of past forest management, the timing of transition from natural to plantation forests, population density and distribution, and access to resources and markets. Boreal forests are dominated by pioneer species that are resilient to disturbance and have a demonstrated ability to adapt to past climate changes. National responses to natural disturbances are linked to forest area, ownership, and management intensity. Boreal forests in large nations (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation) are typically publicly owned, and disturbances such as fire are allowed to progress naturally over remote areas. In smaller nations, where there is often a greater proportion of private ownership and a focus on production forestry, natural disturbances are more aggressively controlled (e.g., Sweden, Finland). Large nations with low boreal human population densities have a greater proportion of natural boreal forest, with relatively higher levels of biodiversity when compared to the fully managed forests of some smaller boreal nations. In smaller nations, the combination of limited forest area and private ownership has facilitated the dominance of intensive sustainable forestry management practices (e.g., Finland). Conversely, in nations with more spatially extensive forest assets that are publicly owned and managed to meet multiple objectives, extensive sustainable forest management practices dominate (e.g., Canada, Russian Federation).},

However, the segments differ profoundly regarding volume, price, type, and amount of needed feedstock, market condition, societal contributions as well as maturity, etc. This article aims to analyse a set of five different value chains in the technological innovation system (TIS) framework in order to derive adequate policy conclusions. Hereby, we focus on quite distinctive value chains to take into account the high heterogeneity of biotechnological applications. The analysis points out that policy maker have to take into account the fundamental differences in the innovation systems and to implement differentiated innovation policy to address system weaknesses.

However, information about innovation activities in the bioeconomy and its outcomes is scattered and more systematic measurement efforts are useful for policy making to assess its impact and whether objectives are met. This article provides an overview of information needs and data availability for innovation indicators. Furthermore, data for key input and throughput indicators are presented and discussed for the bioeconomy in Germany. The data indicates a rather strong role of Germany for publications and patents. However, the commercial success remains unclear, because of current limitations in information availability about the output and outcome of innovations efforts. Here, the most critical information gap in exist. In order to improve this situation additional data collection such as innovation survey for the bioeconomy would be needed.},

  abstract = {The building energy performance gap is a critical obstacle to emissions reduction and energy conservation. Previous research mainly focused on identifying the factors contributing to the building energy performance gap (BEPG). Such studies have tended toward an inward-looking perspective that treats impact factors in isolation from one another. In reality, most factors are interrelated and associated with energy-related stakeholders. To address this research gap, this research developed a social network analysis model to investigate the underlying network of stakeholder-related influencing factors. According to nodal degree, status centrality, betweenness centrality, and brokerage roles, 21 factors and 14 links that substantially influence other factors directly or indirectly are identified. Six challenges, including “Challenges to knowledge and experience,” “Challenges in determining who is responsible for BEPG among stakeholders,” “Cost challenges,” “Poor quality challenges,” “Challenges to building operation management,” and “Information integrity challenges,” are further identified. Moreover, six strategies that are useful in controlling and eliminating influencing factors and interactions are proposed. The results show that, after the proposed strategies were conducted, the density and cohesion of the network are reduced by 48.28\% and 11.62\%, respectively, and the top ten betweenness centrality values for the nodes and links are reduced by at least 30\%. This research is expected to aid not only researchers in better understanding the intricate interrelationships among the factors influencing BEPG but also practitioners in effectively controlling the influencing factors of BEPG.},

In this paper, a new long-term annual land cover dataset (the Climate Change Initiative Land Cover or CCI-LC dataset) with a spatial resolution of 300~m was employed to estimate the ESV of China, and Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchy models were built to examine the detailed patterns and anthropogenic driving factors. From 1992 to 2018, the total ESV of China fluctuated and decreased from 3265.3 to 3253.29 billion US\$ at an average rate of 0.55 billion US\$ per year. Furthermore, the model revealed the spatiotemporal variations in the ESV pattern, and simultaneously detected the influences of 9 variables related to economic factors, population, infrastructure, energy, agriculture and ecological restoration, providing a convenient and effective method for ESV spatiotemporal analysis. The results enrich our understanding of the detailed spatiotemporal variation and anthropogenic driving factors underlying the declining ESV in China. These findings have substantial guiding implications for adjusting ecological regulation policies.},

In this paper, we identify and analyze structural breaks using machine learning methodologies. We find that downward trend shifts in carbon emissions since 1965 are rare, and most trend shifts are associated with non-climate structural factors (such as a change in the economic structure) rather than with climate policies. While we do not explicitly analyze the optimal mix between climate and non-climate policies, our findings highlight the importance of the nonclimate policies in reducing carbon emissions. On the methodology front, our paper contributes to the climate toolbox by identifying country-specific structural breaks in emissions for top 20 emitters based on a user-friendly machine-learning tool and interpreting the results using a decomposition of carbon emission ( Kaya Identity).},

We revisit the long-standing debate on how latecomers may break free from the trajectories of the developed countries and leapfrog into more sustainable directions. Connecting insights from the fields of catching-up, socio-technical transitions, and economic geography, we propose a heuristic typology of four development pathways for latecomers. While the catching-up literature has focused on knowledge development as a main strategy, we posit that to address grand challenges, it is imperative for latecomers to implement valuation-focused strategies, which include shaping technology legitimacy, markets, and finance flows at the systemic level. We showcase the shifting trajectory of the Chinese solar photovoltaic industry from technology catching-up to forging ahead in pre-existing global value chains, and eventually towards transformative leapfrogging aimed at reconfiguring the entire socio-technical system of the electricity sector. We conclude with a research agenda for latecomer development.},

Forests are the largest carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems with a high carbon density and a fast carbon accumulation rate, and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. In this paper, the dynamic change and influence factors of forest carbon sequestration efficiency was analysis using the Data Envelopment Analysis Malmquist method in province level~of China. The results showed that Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Tibet, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia had the highest carbon sequestration, while northern China, eastern China, and southwestern China had the highest carbon sequestration efficiency. Furthermore, the factors of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, urbanization, and the length of the highway network had significant positive impacts on the carbon sequestration efficiencies, while the total imports and exports had a significant negative impact. Ecological afforestation, temperature, GDP per capita, urbanization, population, and total imports and exports had spillover effects. It is recommended that the northeastern, central-southern, and southwestern regions with high carbon sequestration efficiencies should be used as the main areas to enhance carbon sinks in the future, and the areas with low efficiencies should respect the laws of nature more. Provinces should take into account the characteristics of the science and technology needs of forest areas and should provide forestry technology extension services. The results of this study are of great significance to improving the efficiency of financial investments, forest quality, and carbon sinks.},

We found that managed land accounted for 30–45\% of the IAV of S               net               over 1959–2015, while the contribution of intact land is reduced by more than half compared with previous assessments of the global carbon budget.

Despite the projections of the global population and economic growth under the framework of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), little is known of land use/cover change (LUCC) at a fine spatial resolution and how carbon pools respond to LUCC under different SSPs. This study projected the future global LUCC with 1~km spatial resolution and a 10-year time step from 2010 to 2100 and then explored its direct impacts on aboveground biomass carbon (AGB) under SSPs. Scenario SSP3 yields the highest global cropland expansion, among which approximately 48\% and 46\% is expected to be located in the current forest land and grassland, respectively. Scenario SSP1 has the largest forest expansion and is mainly converted from grassland (54\%) and cropland (30\%). Due to the spatial change in land use/cover, global AGB loss is expected to reach approximately 3.422~Pg~C in 2100 under scenario SSP3 and increases by approximately 0.587~Pg~C under scenario SSP1. Africa is expected to lose 30\% of AGB under the scenario SSP3. Aboveground biomass in Asia will fix 0.774~Pg~C to reverse the AGB loss in 2100 under scenario SSP1. The global carbon loss estimated by the land use products with 10~km and 25~km resolution are less than that with 1~km by 1.5\% (ranging from −11.2\% in Africa to +34.0\% in Oceania) and 2.9\% (ranging from −11.8\% in Africa to +24.0\% in Oceania), respectively. These findings suggest that sufficient spatial details in the existing SSP scenario projections could reduce the uncertainties of AGB assessment, and reasonable land use development and management is a key measure to mitigate the negative impacts of LUCC on the biomass carbon pool.},

The technique effect caused by changes in input mix, sector energy intensity, fuel mix and carbon coefficients effectively offset part of the scale effect during the entire period but failed to do so during some sub-periods. Changes in trade composition caused a relative small increase in the carbon emissions created by exports but a relative small decrease in the carbon emissions avoided via imports during the whole period.},

  abstract = {Keywords can express the main content of an article or a sentence. Keywords extraction is a critical issue in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and can improve the performance of many NLP systems. The traditional methods of keywords extraction are based on machine learning or graph model. The performance of these methods is influenced by the feature selection and the manually defined rules. In recent years, with the emergence of deep learning technology, learning features automatically with the deep learning algorithm can improve the performance of many tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model for the task of keywords extraction. We make two extensions on the basis of traditional LSTM model. First, to better utilize both the historic and following contextual information of the given target word, we propose a target center-based LSTM model (TC-LSTM), which learns to encode the target word by considering its contextual information. Second, on the basis of TC-LSTM model, we apply the self-attention mechanism, which enables our model has an ability to focus on informative parts of the associated text. In addition, we also introduce a two-stage training method, which takes advantage of large-scale pseudo training data. Experimental results show the advantage of our method, our model beats all the baseline systems all across the board. And also, the two-stage training method is of great significance for improving the effectiveness of the model.},

  abstract = {Climate change can directly affect forest hydrology by altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation, or indirectly by changing disturbance regimes and forest structures at multiple scales. Climate change impacts on the forest-water nexus across biomes are pervasive characterized by a great complexity and uncertainty, significantly impeding the design of adaptive forest watershed management to mitigate climate change risks. This paper reviews our current knowledge on the interactions between climate change and the forest-water nexus at the scales of individual tree, stand, and watershed. We found that climate change dramatically altered watershed hydrology in many parts of the world, with varying hydrological responses at multiple scales of tree species, forest types, climate types, and hydrological regimes. The streamflow response was often more pronounced in snow-dominated or water-limited watersheds, especially in watersheds with increasing droughts due to climate change and intensively managed plantations of either non-native tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Australia) or young coniferous species. Climate change impacts can be compounded or offset by forest changes (i.e., deforestation, and forestation) through forest-climate interactions and feedbacks. Forest management can mitigate or aggravate the negative hydrologic impacts of climate change. Adaptive forest management is a prerequisite for managing the forest-water nexus in the face of climate change. Various forest management strategies aiming at maintaining optimal forest structure and high species diversity are recommended to enhance forest resistance and resilience to climate change and sustain water provision services from forests and other beneficial ecosystem services while minimizing negative impacts and risks of climate change.},

Findings reflect the harmful role of EPU. However, RE and ETs have a supportive role in the transition towards a sustainable environment.

After correcting for classical measurement errors using instrumental variables, I find that conventional estimates of intergenerational elasticities could severely underestimate the extent of father-son association in socioeconomic status. Instrumenting one measure of the father’s outcome with a second measure of the father’s outcome raises the intergenerational elasticities (β) of occupational status from 0.4 to 0.6-0.7. Victorian England was therefore a society of limited social mobility. The implications of my results for long-run evolution and international comparisons of social mobility in England are discussed.},

However, research on social innovation and biodiversity is dispersed and covers a multitude of disciplines. A systematic overview of research on social innovation and biodiversity is missing and this paper contributes by focusing on social innovation to tackle the drivers of biodiversity loss and unsustainability. The paper reviews research on social innovation in changing land use (agriculture, forestry, aquatic ecosystems and cities), in tackling exploitation of organisms (fishing, hunting, harvesting), and in addressing threats of climate change, pollution and invasive species. Across these drivers, we find a) a strong emphasis on social innovation as civic action for changing practices in addressing unsustainability, b) that social innovation research tends to focus on local experimentation although there are bodies of literature on policy-driven innovations and consumer/producer-driven innovations, and c) that there is very little research taking a critical perspective to explore negative or unintended consequences of social innovation. Drawing on the review, we propose three cross cutting issues that can be a focus for future research, practice and supportive policy: social innovation for nature-based solutions, social innovation for participatory governance, and social innovation for technology that tackles biodiversity loss.},

  abstract = {The so-called circular economy—the concept of closing material loops to preserve products, parts, and materials in the industrial system and extract their maximum utility—has recently started gaining momentum. The idea of substituting lower-impact secondary production for environmentally intensive primary production gives the circular economy a strong intuitive environmental appeal. However, proponents of the circular economy have tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy. Recent research has started to question the core of the circular economy—namely, whether closing material and product loops does, in fact, prevent primary production. In this article, we argue that circular economy activities can increase overall production, which can partially or fully offset their benefits. Because there is a strong parallel in this respect to energy efficiency rebound, we have termed this effect “circular economy rebound.” Circular economy rebound occurs when circular economy activities, which have lower per-unit-production impacts, also cause increased levels of production, reducing their benefit. We describe the mechanisms that cause circular economy rebound, which include the limited ability of secondary products to substitute for primary products, and price effects. We then offer some potential strategies for avoiding circular economy rebound. However, these strategies are unlikely to be attractive to for-profit firms, so we caution that simply encouraging private firms to find profitable opportunities in the circular economy is likely to cause rebound and lower or eliminate the potential environmental benefits.},

This paper develops a critical and diversified viewpoint on technology for degrowth. ‘Classical perspectives’ of Illich's convivial society, Elull's critique of technique, Mumford's tools and machines, and Schumacher's critique of gigantic techno-infrastructures are explored and combined with Arendt's instrumentality of technologies and Marxist perspectives on ownership. Two questions are posed regarding technology. First, which technologies are 'suitable' for a degrowth context? Previous frameworks by Illich and Schumacher are extended by ecological aspects to assess the suitability of technologies. Second, how should 'suitable' technologies be structured to enable egalitarian utilization? Here, Schumacher's “intermediate technologies” and ownership are central elements. The frameworks and analysis add value for degrowth activists and bridge the gap scientifically between Marxist views and those of degrowth. In conclusion, technologies in degrowth are suitable if they reduce ecological impact, enhance autonomy and conviviality, and are structurally available in an egalitarian way based on openaccess regimes. In the discussion further research questions are posed regarding transforming agents and power relations between grassroots and the state. Limitations of the framework include the role of digital technologies for communication, here treated as electric tools, and the focus on industrialized societies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Subsequently, we utilize this framework to systematically assess 217 peer-reviewed papers in the field of transition studies, to distill key methodological patterns and trends of the field.

In response, we draw on the technological innovation systems perspective and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to develop a theory-guided and entity-based simulation model to better understand, among others, electric vehicle (EV) adoption processes as a specific yet core element driving business innovation. By doing so, our model is among the first to capture and combine the macro-and micro-level interactions associated with the EV transition process. Our simulation results shed light on the impact of alternative innovation policies, notably by explaining relations between EV market dynamics and changes in e-mobility policies, such as EV-related subsidies and resource mobilization. As such, the simulation modeling approach adopted in this paper enables a more in-depth study of transition problems related to e-mobility. Notably, the resulting modular model can be adjusted to other e-mobility transition problems by changing the specified entities.},

However, potential conflicts between housing and sustainability objectives remain under-researched. We explore the impact of current English government housing policy, and alternative housing strategies, on national carbon and biodiversity goals. Using material flow and land use change/biodiversity models, we estimate from 2022 to 2050 under current policy housing alone would consume 104\% of England's cumulative carbon budget (2.6/2.5Gt [50\% chance of~{$<~$}1.5~°C]); 12\% from the construction and operation of newbuilds and 92\% from the existing stock. Housing expansion also potentially conflicts with England's biodiversity targets. However, meeting greater housing need without rapid housing expansion is theoretically possible. We review solutions including improving affordability by reducing demand for homes as financial assets, macroprudential policy, expanding social housing, and reducing underutilisation of floor-space. Transitioning to housing strategies which slow housing expansion and accelerate low-carbon retrofits would achieve lower emissions, but we show that they face an unfavourable political economy and structural economic barriers.},
